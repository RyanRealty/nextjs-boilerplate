            Most Bend homeowners try FSBO to maximize profit. But data shows that self-listed homes in
            Central Oregon often sell for 10% to 26% less than agent-listed homes. Do not step over
            dollars to pick up pennies.

            It is the right mindset. You want to protect your equity. But in today&apos;s complex market,
            avoiding a commission often results in a lower final sales price. We believe you should make
            decisions based on math, not sales pitches.
