// @no-static-params — build-time fan-out budgeted to zero (ci:ssg-budget); ISR on demand
/**
 * /subdivisions/[slug] — the plat grain, on the components/site/v3 barrel.
 *
 * VISUAL LANGUAGE: design_system/public/PUBLIC_UI.md §3. First screen is
 * H1 the plat name + living atlas + PlaceSplitView, the same composition as
 * city / neighborhood / community. Atlas is the inventory graphic. The atlas
 * ring is this place (self). Do not cage that screen in V3Stage or V3Field.
 * Never say "plat" in visitor copy. Giant 0 is forbidden on a timed-out read.
 * Schools sit after the Split when the MLS modal actually publishes. Section
 * order is the parity contract at
 * design_system/ryan-realty/ui_kits/subdivision/parity.json.
 *
 * THE RHYTHM RULE AND CONDITIONAL SECTIONS, DECLARED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. Four
 * of this page's sections render only when their data exists, and no ordering
 * of four independent conditionals over four patterns can guarantee "no two
 * adjacent sections share a pattern" for every combination. The order below is
 * correct when the data is present and degrades to at worst one repeated pair;
 * the alternative is dropping a section the data supports, which §0 forbids.
 *
 * NO-404 CONTRACT. For each incoming slug the page tries the resolution paths
 * in order and renders when ANY succeeds:
 *   1. GIS boundary — getGeoBoundaryMapData geoType='subdivision' returns a polygon.
 *   2. Registry alias — data/resort-communities.json subdivision_aliases holds a
 *      match (slugify(alias) === slug).
 *   3. Active listings — getPlatPublicInventory (REGISTRY plats only) or, for a
 *      plain recorded plat, a direct SFR + PUBLIC_ACTIVE tile read on the
 *      slug's MLS SubdivisionName (path 3b in loadSubdivisionCore).
 * The refusal fires ONLY when every path is empty AND every read succeeded.
 *
 * THE REDIRECT IS NOT HERE, AND MUST NOT COME BACK. middleware.ts runs
 * resolveSubdivisionAreaRedirect(slug) on every /subdivisions/<slug> request
 * before render (lib/routing/pre-render-hops.ts), so a marketing-area slug has
 * already been 308-ed and can never reach this component. A page-body
 * permanentRedirect could not set a Location header anyway — this segment
 * renders inside the Suspense boundary app/loading.tsx opens, so React has
 * already flushed HTTP 200. Enforced by scripts/check-streamed-redirect.mjs.
 *
 * THE PAGE CONTRACT, CARRIED ACROSS UNCHANGED: generateMetadata through
 * pageMetadata with the same title, description, path and indexability rule
 * (one cached getIndexableSubdivisions read serves both the robots policy and
 * the plat's real city, so a non-registry plat titles itself with a city that
 * exists instead of "Central Oregon, Oregon"), MetadataBlock JSON-LD
 * (BreadcrumbList + Place, same payloads, same hasMap condition), the section
 * tracker, force-dynamic rendering (see the route-config comment), dynamicParams
 * true, generateStaticParams returning [], and maxDuration 60. MetadataBlock stays on the legacy register: JSON-LD is not
 * visual language and ci:ai-structured-data pins this route to it by name.
 *
 * FIVE POPULATIONS, FIVE TRACES (CLAUDE.md §0). Every sentence that describes
 * one lives in _v3/subdivision-traces.ts, and no section prints a figure its own
 * trace does not cover:
 *   1. The plat's active count and the homes — getPlatPublicInventory, the
 *      recorded-plat SFR + PUBLIC_ACTIVE set. Do NOT fall back to a capped
 *      featured fetch or an unfiltered pin count: those were the 12 / 14 / 26
 *      split on Ridge At Eagle Crest (2026-08-16). A measured empty must not
 *      revive townhouses.
 *   2. The Market Truth recorded-plat counts — getSubdivisionCounts, detached
 *      membership, with the other property types as their own enumeration.
 *   3. The plat's own closed statistics — market_stats_cache at geoType
 *      'subdivision', periodType 'ytd' (pinned by ci:subdivision-stats-integrity).
 *   4. The yearly closed aggregates — the get_subdivision_sales_history RPC.
 *      ODS rule 5-4 A.4: aggregates only, never an individual sold address.
 *   5. The plat's LIFETIME closed count and its year series — the
 *      subdivision_plat_closed_mv union, attributed by the sale's coordinates
 *      falling inside the recorded plat polygon and by the MLS name, counted
 *      once either way (SITE-24). Populations 3 and 4 are name joins, so they
 *      are EMPTY for every sub-plat of a resort — every home inside Golf Homes
 *      At Tetherow is filed under "Tetherow" — and this is the only one of the
 *      five such a page can state anything from. It is counts only; a
 *      closed-price statistic at plat grain stays withheld.
 *
 * ABSENT IS NOT ZERO. A boundary or inventory read that times out leaves the
 * same empty array a genuinely empty plat leaves, so activeCount is null in that
 * case and the homes section says it has no count rather than publishing a zero
 * under a live-MLS trace.
 *
 * THE PARENT PULSE IS NOT ON THIS PAGE, AND MUST NOT COME BACK. A registry plat
 * has no market_pulse_live row of its own. City and community pulse are OTHER
 * geographies, and printing one under "homes for sale in {plat}" attributed
 * Redmond's pending days to Ridge At Eagle Crest — the founding case behind
 * lib/market/publish-plat-figures.ts and ci:publish-plat-figures (2026-08-16).
 * publishPlatFigures is the whole rule: the counted set's own median may
 * publish; days-to-pending and 30-day sold WITHHOLD rather than borrow. The KB
 * page's parent-market band and fetchSubdivMarketExtras went with that fix and
 * are not restored here.
 *
 * DELETIONS THIS MIGRATION MAKES, AND WHERE THE INFORMATION WENT:
 *   KbHero              — the plat's homes open the page. The count, the median
 *                         list and the days figure are figures on the market
 *                         Instrument, each under its own trace.
 *   KbFeatured          — the homes Ledger, or the Field when the plat has four
 *                         or more pins.
 *   PlaceMapListSplit / KbListingMap — the same Google map, in the Field's map
 *                         slot, bound to the list both ways, with the recorded
 *                         plat boundary drawn on it.
 *   VideoTourRail       — a plat with in-area video tours flags them on the
 *                         listing rows themselves ("Video tour" in the row's
 *                         meta line), which is the same information attached to
 *                         the home it describes instead of a second rail.
 *   PublicSubdivisionCounts — its detached counts are figures on the market
 *                         Instrument and its extras are the property-type run.
 *   SubdivisionExploreTail (KbExploreTowns + KbSell + the explore sections) —
 *                         every edge it carried is an item in the closing Quiet,
 *                         built by _v3/subdivision-edges.ts.
 *   SmoothScrollProvider, KbFooter, KbBreadcrumb, KbSectionTracker — chrome.
 *
 * Data ONLY through @/lib/data and @/app/actions. No raw .from().

     breadcrumb and its doors. It is used only when the plat is registered to a

     implies the frame was taken on this plat. Never a city photo, never
     another plat's, never a listing photo standing in for a place (§0 applies
     to a picture that makes a claim exactly as it applies to a number).

     SITE-56 CONTINUES THE LADDER PAST THE RESORT, because the two rungs above
     leave most of the class on cream — Matt, reading the page the expired CMA
     links: "There's no map on the diamond bar sub page and no photo." Rung 3

     nothing implies the frame is of the subdivision; rung 4 is the plat's own
     GROUND, drawn from the same public-domain TIGER geometry the Atlas draws,
     captioned as a drawing. The refusal above is unchanged and still absolute:

  /* ── The cited Q&A, and this route's FIRST FAQPage (SITE-08) ─────────────
     The plat node answered nothing in a reader's own words: it drew a map, a
     list, a market band and a year table, and left every question a person
     types unanswered and unindexed. This closes it with the same primitive the
     neighborhood and community grains use, on the same figures this page is
     ALLOWED to publish and no others.

     WHAT THE PLAT GRAIN MAY SAY, AND WHY THE SET IS SHORT. REGISTRY §4:
     a subdivision publishes counts and individual sales, never a price
     statistic — 515 of 680 Bend plats never reach ten detached sales in 36
     months, and the yearly series is an MLS SubdivisionName join rather than
     place membership. So a closed median, a year-over-year of it, and a
     sale-to-list ratio (a ratio of two prices, on the same thin join) all stay
     off. Months of supply stays off too: lib/market/geo-grain-trust.ts refuses
     this grain's closed attribution, so the verdict question is ASKED and
     answered with the refusal and the count behind it, which is the honest
     version. What publishes: the live list median of the plat's own actives,
     days on market from the plat's own cache row, the active count, and the
     yearly closed counts the sales-history Ledger already prints.

     THE LATEST COMPLETE YEAR, not the running one. The current calendar year is
     a partial window and comparing it to a full one is not a year (the same
     rule subdivisionSalesChart applies to its own current-year bar). */

     only one whose count row can draw a second run of marks and let the reader
     see the change as a length. It has to be the immediately preceding year and
     it has to come out of this same salesHistory array — a count from another
