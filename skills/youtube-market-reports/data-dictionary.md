# Data Dictionary — Listings Table

## Overview
- 589K+ rows in `listings` table (Supabase project `dwvlophlbvvygjfxcrhm`)
- 131 table-level columns (~65 promoted from JSONB + ~17 trigger-computed derived + engagement/history columns)
- 821 distinct keys in `details` JSONB column (raw RESO/Spark API data)
- Typical SFR listing: ~221 populated JSONB keys + ~120 masked (IDX-restricted, value = `"********"`)
- Pipeline: Spark API -> details JSONB (821 keys verbatim) -> listing-mapper.ts sparkToListingRow() -> ~65 typed table columns -> compute_listing_derived_fields() trigger -> 17 computed metrics

## Column Naming Convention
- RETS mixed-case columns MUST be double-quoted in SQL: `"ListPrice"`, `"ClosePrice"`, `"StandardStatus"`, `"BedroomsTotal"`, `"BathroomsTotal"`, `"TotalLivingAreaSqFt"`, `"OnMarketDate"`, `"OriginalListPrice"`, `"SubdivisionName"`, `"PostalCode"`, `"CloseDate"`, `"StreetNumber"`, `"StreetName"`, `"Latitude"`, `"Longitude"`, `"PhotoURL"`, `"PropertyType"`, `"ListNumber"`, `"CumulativeDaysOnMarket"`, etc.
- Lowercase columns need no quoting: `details`, `year_built`, `property_sub_type`, `new_construction_yn`, `concessions_amount`, `buyer_financing`, `tax_annual_amount`, `school_district`, `walk_score`, `pending_timestamp`, `price_per_sqft`, `sale_to_list_ratio`, `sale_to_final_list_ratio`, `estimated_monthly_piti`, etc.
- When in doubt, query `information_schema.columns` first. Never guess column names.

## Supporting Tables

### listing_history (4.3M rows)
Every MLS field change. Key columns: listing_key, field_name, old_value, new_value, changed_at, price_change (decimal fraction).

### price_history (345K rows)
Price change events: listing_key, old_price, new_price, change_pct, changed_at.

### status_history (3.4K rows)
Status transitions: listing_key, old_status, new_status, changed_at.

### market_pulse_live (10 rows)
Live dashboard for 9 cities + Central Oregon region. Pre-computed: median_sale_price, active_count, pending_count, closed_last_30/60/90_days, months_of_supply (**WRONG — DO NOT USE**), absorption_rate_pct, sell_through_rate_90d, expired_rate_90d, price_reduction_share, median_days_to_pending.

**WARNING (see `query-rules.md` C3 + UF3):** `market_pulse_live.months_of_supply` mixes ALL `PropertyType='A'` sub-types (SFR, condo, manufactured, land artifacts) and uses an undocumented 90d/3 formula. Measured Bend gap on 2026-04-30 = stored `5.80` vs SFR-only manual `4.20` — 38% off; both land in the Balanced band at this snapshot but a 38% delta is large enough to flip the verdict pill against the next month's data. **Never read this column into a video.** Always recompute MoS with `query-rules.md` Template 11. The same mixed-subtypes skew likely affects `absorption_rate_pct`, `sell_through_rate_90d`, and `median_days_to_pending` on this view — for video use, recompute those metrics manually with the SFR filter (see `storyboard-template.md` Scene 5 spec).

### market_stats_cache (1.4K rows)
Pre-computed stats by geography/period. Missing market_health_label and yoy_median_price_delta_pct (mostly NULL).

### beacon_comparable_listings_v (view)
Main analytics view on top of listings. Adds computed DOM/market columns. Uses `EXTRACT(epoch FROM interval) / 86400.0` for DOM (disagrees with trigger by +/-1 day). Excludes lots over 5 acres (lot_size_sqft < 217,800). Uses hardcoded zip-to-city mappings for 16 zips. **Note: computes legacy DOM via CloseDate–OnMarketDate math. For video stats, use `days_to_pending` column on `listings` directly — Beacon Appraisal methodology, 100% populated.**

## How to Query JSONB Fields

```sql
-- String field
SELECT details->>'GreenEnergyEfficient' FROM listings WHERE "ListingKey" = 'abc123';

-- Object field (multi-value enum)
SELECT details->'ArchitecturalStyle' FROM listings WHERE "ListingKey" = 'abc123';
-- Returns: {"Craftsman": true, "Northwest": true}

-- Filter on JSONB value
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM listings
WHERE details->>'GreenEnergyGeneration' IS NOT NULL
  AND "City" = 'Bend' AND "PropertyType" = 'A';

-- Aggregate JSONB field
SELECT details->>'Zoning' AS zoning, COUNT(*)
FROM listings
WHERE "City" = 'Bend' AND "StandardStatus" = 'Active'
GROUP BY details->>'Zoning'
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

## Schema Discovery Query
When in doubt, query the schema first:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'listings'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```
