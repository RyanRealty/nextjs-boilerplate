name: media-sourcing
description: Canonical decision skill for choosing image, video, and audio sources across every Ryan Realty content build. Covers asset library, Unsplash, Shutterstock, Pexels, Pixabay, Supabase listing photos, AI image generation (Vertex Imagen 4, Nano Banana 2, Grok Imagine), AI video generation (Kling, Veo 3, Hailuo, Seedance, Wan, Luma Ray, LTX, Hunyuan), specialty pipelines (depth_parallax, depthflow, earth_zoom, Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles), and ambient audio (Veo native, ElevenLabs SFX, Foley Control). Use this skill BEFORE any video, blog, or ad render whenever the agent needs to pick where a photo / clip / SFX comes from. Use this skill whenever the user says "where should I get the photo for X", "what's the right tool for [B-roll / hero / drone / animation]", "make a video clip from this image", "generate an image of X", or any other media-sourcing decision. Use this skill ALSO when reviewing why a render's photos look generic, mismatched, or off-brand — the answer is usually in the sourcing decision tree below.

# Media Sourcing Skill — Ryan Realty

**Scope:** Single decision skill for choosing image, video, and audio sources for every Ryan Realty content build. Replaces the scattered "use Unsplash" defaults and ad-hoc fetch scripts with one routing document.

**Status:** Authored 2026-05-07 from the full media-tools audit. Cross-referenced from every video / blog / ad skill.

**Key insight:** the team has paid access or live integrations for ~20 distinct media sources. The agent's job is not to know every source — it's to pick the right source FOR THIS ASK. This skill is the routing logic.

## 1. Hard rules (override everything below)

These rules trump every cost/speed/preference signal. If you are about to break one, halt and surface to Matt.

1. **No AI imagery for listing interiors, ever.** A listing video MUST use real MLS photos for every interior shot. AI substitutes for kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. = compliance fail (misrepresentation) per Oregon real estate practice.
2. **No fabricated Bend geography.** AI generation is banned for Bend / Smith Rock / Mt. Bachelor / Old Mill / any specific Central Oregon landmark. Fake Pilot Butte = fake Bend = trust fail. Use a real photo (asset library / Shutterstock / Unsplash) or skip the visual.
3. **AI imagery requires the AI VISUALIZATION caption tag** when used for news clips, market reports, or anywhere the viewer might assume the image is real. Per `ANTI_SLOP_MANIFESTO.md`.
4. **Shutterstock requires per-asset license before production use.** Search and preview is free; rendering a licensed asset into a deliverable that ships is a compliance step. Track license IDs in `citations.json`.
5. **Supabase listing photos are the ONLY source for listing video photos.** No exceptions, no AI substitutes. Min 15 photos required to build a listing reel — if fewer, halt.
6. **Imagen 4 sunsets June 30, 2026.** After that date, route to Nano Banana 2. Update any code path that still references `imagen-4` before the cutover.
7. **No photo repeats inside a single render.** Per `market-data-video/SKILL.md` §20. The diversity assertion in `build-cities.mjs::assignPhotoSlots()` enforces this — never bypass it.
8. **No people-as-subject in market-report photos.** Photos with humans as the subject (rock climbers, hikers, models) are banned for market-report scenes per `market-data-video/SKILL.md` §9. Background figures are OK; foreground people are not.

### 2.4 Specialty pipelines

| Pipeline | Status | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **depth_parallax** (MiDaS) | ✅ Coded, deps required | Hero exterior shots with strong depth layers — turns a still photo into a dolly-zoom effect |
| **depthflow_pipeline** (Depth Anything V2) | ⚠️ Scaffolded, not installed | Better than MiDaS at depth discontinuities (eaves, rooflines). Install before next listing build. |
| **cinematic_transitions** | ✅ Live | 5 Remotion transition components: Crossfade, LightLeak, WhipPan, Push, Slide |
| **audio_sync** | ✅ Live | Beat-detection + match-cuts via ffmpeg + librosa |
| **earth_zoom** | ✅ Live (manual step) | Google Earth Studio (browser) → PNG sequence → Remotion. Aerial-to-ground intros. |
| **Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles** | ✅ Live | Property flyovers from lat/lng. Already used in `video/cascade-peaks/`. |
| **Synthesia** (avatar video) | ✅ Live | Matt avatar weekly market updates. AI disclosure required. |

### 2.5 Ambient audio / SFX

| **ElevenLabs Sound Effects** | ✅ Live (same key as VO) | One-off SFX: whoosh, sub-bass thump, transition sounds. `/v1/sound-generation` |
| **Foley Control** (fal.ai) | ⚠️ Balance | Generates synced ambient SFX from a silent video input. Unique — no equivalent on Replicate. |
| **Hand-curated royalty-free music** | ✅ Existing library | `public/audio/` — hand-curated tracks from Pixabay Music, Uppbeat, YouTube Audio Library, Artlist, Epidemic Sound |

## 3. Decision tree — pick a source by asset need

### Need a real Bend / Central Oregon landmark photo
Asset library (`asset_index.py search --geo bend`) → Unsplash with landmark-specific query (Pilot Butte, Mt. Bachelor, Old Mill, Drake Park, Smith Rock, Tumalo Falls, Three Sisters) → Shutterstock licensed search → **Do NOT** use AI generation (Hard rule §1.2).

### Need a listing exterior or interior photo
Supabase `listing_photos` table ONLY. No substitutes. If <15 photos available, halt and wait for photographer delivery.

### Need cinematic motion FROM a listing photo (animated B-roll for listing reels)
Kling v2.1 Master (default, $1.40 / 5s) → Wan 2.5 i2v (when start-frame fidelity matters) → Hailuo 02 (lifestyle / people) → Seedance 1 Pro (budget volume). **Never** for listing interiors — depth_parallax or Ken Burns only for interior shots.

### Need city B-roll for a market report
Veo 3 Fast via Replicate ($1.25 / 5s, includes ambient audio) → Veo 3 ($2.50, higher quality) → Asset library + Ken Burns → Unsplash with **landmark-specific** queries (NOT generic "mountain" stock).

### Need a luxury property video (Tetherow, Awbrey, $1.5M+)
Luma Ray 2 720p ($0.40 / s, drone-language sweeps) + Veo 3 for ambient-audio beats + licensed Shutterstock 4K luxury interior footage **only when it does not contradict the actual home's reality**.

### Need a stylized illustration (evergreen / educational content)
Grok Imagine (`grok-imagine-image-pro`) → Replicate FLUX Schnell (cheap, fast) → Imagen 4 (brand color discipline, sunset 2026-06-30) → Nano Banana 2 post-cutover.

### Need news clip footage
Shutterstock (licensed, preferred for credibility) → Unsplash (free fallback for generic B-roll) → Remotion code-generated graphics → AI generation as last resort with required "AI VISUALIZATION" caption tag.

### Need a drone / aerial shot
Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles + Remotion (property flyover from `listings.Latitude/Longitude`) → Google Earth Studio (free, browser-only, earth-zoom intro) → Luma Ray 2 T2V with "aerial sweep" prompt → Real drone footage (when delivered by photographer).

### Need lifestyle / community B-roll (dog parks, trails, breweries)
Asset library first → Pixabay video (free, commercial OK, no attribution) → Shutterstock images (free plan) → Unsplash stills + Ken Burns motion.

### Need ambient audio / SFX for a video
Veo 3 native ambient audio (generated WITH the visual clip) → ElevenLabs Sound Effects (one-off SFX, same key as VO) → Foley Control on fal.ai (when balance restored) → Hand-curated track from `public/audio/`.

### Need an in-image text overlay (price, address, date baked in)
Nano Banana 2 (post-fal-balance-restore) — unique capability, no equivalent on Replicate. If unavailable, fall back to Remotion text overlay rendered separately.

## 5. Cost ledger (per video / deliverable)

| Format | Typical media cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Market report short-form | $0 (Unsplash) — $30 (Shutterstock images) | Free path is the default. Upgrade to Shutterstock when Unsplash inventory is thin for the city. |
| YouTube long-form | $5 — $50 | Adds ~5 Veo 3 Fast clips ($6) + maybe one Luma Ray hero ($2). |
| Listing reel (standard) | $20 — $40 | 6–12 Kling v2.1 Master clips at $1.40 each = $8–$17. Plus depth_parallax (free). |
| Listing reel (luxury) | $60 — $200 | Luma Ray 2 hero ($2) + Veo 3 ambient beats ($10) + Shutterstock 4K interior B-roll ($15-50) + Kling ($30). |
| News clip | $5 — $25 | Shutterstock licensed footage if used ($10) + maybe one Veo 3 Fast ($2). |
| Neighborhood overview | $0 — $20 | Asset library + Unsplash + Pixabay video = $0. Upgrade if production volume justifies. |
| Avatar market update | ~$3 (Synthesia minute fee) | + ElevenLabs ~$0.50 for VO. |
| Blog hero image | $0 — $0.20 | Imagen 4 or Grok Imagine. Or screenshot a chart from the video for free. |
| FB lead-gen ad | $0 incremental | Re-uses the short-form video — no additional media cost. |

Multiply by city count for monthly market reports across 6 cities. Budget guidance: Matt sets a monthly cap; pipeline tracks running total in `citations.json`.

## 7. Integration code snippets (canonical patterns)

The fully-working scripts live at the paths below. Reference rather than copy-paste.

| Source | Script |
|---|---|
| Unsplash fetch | `video/market-report/scripts/fetch-unsplash.mjs` (Bend-specific landmark search + scoring) |
| Asset library lookup | `python3 ~/Documents/Claude/Projects/ASSET_LIBRARY/asset_index.py for {city} --type photo --filter approved` |
| Supabase listing photos | See `listing_reveal/SKILL.md` Step 1 SQL pattern |
| Replicate Kling | See `listing_reveal/SKILL.md` and `listing-tour-video/SKILL.md` for the canonical fetch + poll loop |
| Vertex AI Imagen | `@google/genai` SDK, project `ryan-realty-tc`, location `us-central1` |
| Shutterstock search | See `lifestyle-community/SKILL.md` curl pattern |
| ElevenLabs SFX | `POST /v1/sound-generation` (same auth as VO) |

When the same call appears in 3+ skills, lift it to a script in `video/shared/scripts/` and have skills reference it (single source of truth, kills copy-paste drift).
