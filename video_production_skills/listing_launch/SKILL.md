# Listing Launch — Per-Property Reel + Story + Email + MLS Package

**When to use.** A new listing is going live and you need the full launch package: MLS description, 3 Reel scripts, 7-frame Story sequence, IG static caption, FB post, sphere email. One property, one playbook, one delivery.

**Read first:** [VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SKILL.md](../VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SKILL.md), then [`../brand_assets/SKILL.md`](../brand_assets/SKILL.md) for photo selection, then this file. The video deliverable scaffolds against `listing_video_v4/` (Remotion). The text deliverables run through `brand-voice:enforce-voice`.

---

## Step 1 — Property intelligence

Pull (or extract from attached materials):

- Address + price
- Property type (single family / acreage / condo / luxury)
- Key features (beds / baths / sqft / lot size / views / signature features)
- Primary buyer type (relocator / local / investor / second-home / luxury)
- Photography status (Rich at Framed Visuals — scheduled? Drone included?)
- MLS go-live date
- Open house planned?

## Step 2 — Identify the emotional core

Before any copy: identify the ONE emotional story this property tells. Not a feature list — a feeling. Every piece of content reinforces this.

| Property type | Likely core |
|---------------|-------------|
| Mountain views + acreage | Solitude, connection to nature, room to breathe |
| Walkable old Bend neighborhood | Community, authenticity, local roots |
| Modern updated kitchen | Entertaining, gathering, food culture |
| Bend in general | Outdoor adventure, lifestyle choice, intentional living |

## Step 3 — MLS description (200–400 words)

**Framework:** Features → Lifestyle → Benefits.
- **Opening:** start with the feeling/lifestyle (not "Welcome to this stunning home").
- **Middle:** feature-benefit pairs woven into narrative prose (not a list).
- **Closing:** why now, why here — scarcity or uniqueness angle.

**Voice:** Matt's authentic register — knowledgeable, warm, never salesy. Reads like a thoughtful recommendation from someone who actually knows the property.

**Banned (zero tolerance):** `stunning`, `nestled`, `boasts`, `gorgeous`, `breathtaking`, `must-see`, `dream home`, `won't last long`, `rare opportunity`, em-dashes (—), hyphens in prose ("4-bedroom" → "4 bedrooms").

## Step 4 — Social content package

### Three Reel scripts (different hooks)

Each script needs:
- **Hook (0–3s)** — pick one of: Question Hook ("Would you live here?"), Curiosity Gap, Breaking News ("JUST LISTED in Tumalo"), Bold Take.
- **Body** — feature reveals with emotional narration (or text overlays only — see [`../area_guides/SKILL.md`](../area_guides/SKILL.md) for VO-less format).
- **CTA** — DM-based ("DM me 'tour' for a private showing").
- **Length** — 15–60s of spoken content (or text on screen).
- **Format note** — VO script with scene direction OR text-overlay shot list (the BEATS array for Remotion).

### Instagram Stories (7 frames)

| Frame | Content | Note |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | Hook ("Would you live here?") | Curiosity gap opener |
| 2 | Price reveal | Clean, data-first |
| 3 | Hero feature 1 | Best visual feature |
| 4 | Hero feature 2 | Second best |
| 5 | Location context | Neighborhood / lifestyle |
| 6 | Outdoor / lifestyle | Experience angle |
| 7 | End card | Matt Ryan contact + CTA |

### Instagram static post (feed)

- Hook line (NOT "Just Listed!")
- 2–3 sentences of narrative
- Key specs
- DM CTA
- 10–15 hashtags (location + property type + lifestyle)

### Facebook post

- Slightly longer, more conversational
- Include full address (Facebook search is local)
- Link to MLS listing
- No DM CTA (FB uses Messenger differently — "Message me" works)

## Step 5 — Sphere email

Subject: specific + personal ("Matt here — acreage property in Tumalo coming Thursday")
Body: 150–200 words, warm and personal. Key property details, why this one is worth noting, CTA: reply to schedule a showing or forward to someone who might be interested.

## Step 6 — Open house promotion (if applicable)

- Instagram Story sequence (3–5 frames)
- Facebook event or post
- Email reminder 48 hours before

## Output format

Deliver a single structured document Matt can copy-paste into Canva, FUB, or email:

```
## LISTING: [Address]

### MLS Description
[200–400 words]

### Reel Script 1 — [Hook Type]
[Script with scene directions]

### Reel Script 2 — [Hook Type]
[Script with scene directions]

### Reel Script 3 — [Hook Type]
[Script with scene directions]

### Instagram Story Frames (7)
[Frame-by-frame copy]

### Instagram Static Post
[Caption + hashtags]

### Facebook Post
[Full post copy]

### Sphere Email
Subject: [Subject line]
[Email body]
```

## Reference: 19496 Tumalo Reservoir Rd

The Tumalo Reservoir Rd reel ($1,599,000, 3BR/2.5BA, 2.28 ac, MLS 220193552) is the canonical worked example. Per-photo asset IDs and per-shot Reel beat-by-beat are in [`../brand_assets/SKILL.md`](../brand_assets/SKILL.md) ("Tumalo Reservoir Rd Asset ID Reference"). Watch the rendered file before scaffolding a similar tier — `~/Documents/Claude/Projects/SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER/56111_SchoolHouse_Pending_Reel.mp4` and the Tumalo Reels in the same folder (see [`../ASSET_LOCATIONS.md`](../ASSET_LOCATIONS.md)).

## Quality gate

Master skill §6 applies for video. For text:

- [ ] Brand voice enforcement passed on every piece of copy
- [ ] Zero banned words / em-dashes / cliché lines
- [ ] Every numeric claim (price, acreage, sqft, beds, baths, lot size, MLS#) traces to the listing data sheet — per `CLAUDE.md` §0, no estimate, no "approximately"
- [ ] DM CTA on every IG asset
- [ ] Hashtags: 10–15, mix of location + property type + lifestyle
- [ ] No Zillow auto-description energy — every line should sound like Matt wrote it
- [ ] Email subject is specific + personal (not "Weekly Update")

## Pre-Build QA (mandatory)
Before scaffolding the BEATS array or starting any render:
- Verify the format skill itself was loaded (this skill — required by `scripts/preflight.ts`)
- Pull all data from primary sources (Spark MLS, Supabase, Census, NAR, Case-Shiller — never from training data or memory)
- Write `out/<slug>/citations.json` with every figure → primary-source row before scaffolding BEATS
- Banned-words grep on draft VO + on-screen text BEFORE render
- Validate BEATS structure (12+ beats for 30-45s video, 3+ motion types, no beat over 4s)

## Storyboard Handoff (mandatory unless Matt opts out)
Before render, invoke `storyboard_pass` skill with:
- format = listing_launch
- topic = <address, listing details, and launch package scope>
- target_platforms = IG Reels, TikTok, YT Shorts, IG Stories, Email
- research_data = <data pulled in Pre-Build QA step>

`storyboard_pass` returns the BEATS array, VO script, citation list, music choice, predicted scorecard. Show Matt the 30-second skim. On Matt's "go" → render. On redirect → invoke `feedback_loop` and re-storyboard.

Skip storyboard ONLY when Matt explicitly says "skip storyboard" or "just build it".

## Render
See format-specific render instructions above (full Remotion listing video + copy deliverables). Command pattern:
```
cd listing_video_v4 && npx remotion render src/index.ts ListingLaunch out/<slug>/listing_launch.mp4 --codec h264 --concurrency 1 --crf 22 --image-format=jpeg --jpeg-quality=92
```

## Post-Build QA Pass (mandatory)
After render completes:
- Auto-invoke `qa_pass` skill on the render output at `out/<slug>/listing_launch.mp4`
- `qa_pass` runs all hard refuse conditions, auto-iterates up to 2 cycles on failures, writes `out/<slug>/gate.json`
- If `qa_pass` writes `gatePassed: false` after 2 iterations: the asset goes to `out/_failed/<slug>/` and Matt is told the system could not produce a passing draft. DO NOT show Matt the failed draft.

## Publish Handoff (post-approval only)
After Matt explicitly approves the draft in chat ("ship it", "approved", "publish"):
- Invoke `publish` skill with:
  - mediaUrl = <CDN URL after upload to Supabase Storage from out/<slug>/>
  - mediaType = "reel"
  - platforms = ["ig_reels", "tiktok", "yt_shorts", "fb_reels"]
  - gate = <out/<slug>/gate.json contents>
  - captionDefault = <approved caption>
  - captionPerPlatform = <variants from publish skill best-practice matrix>
  - metadata = <platform-specific options like TikTok privacyLevel, YouTube tags, LinkedIn visibility>

The `publish` skill validates the gate (all paths exist, humanApprovedAt < 7 days), then calls `/api/social/publish` which fans out to platforms.

## Feedback Capture (on rejection)
If Matt rejects the draft or suggests a change:
- Auto-invoke `feedback_loop` skill with:
  - originating_skill = listing_launch
  - asset_path = `out/<slug>/listing_launch.mp4`
  - rejection_reason = <Matt's verbatim words>
  - render_metadata = <gate.json contents>

`feedback_loop` extracts an actionable rule, appends it to this SKILL.md under a `## Lessons learned` section (creating it if absent), and writes a row to `rejection_log` Supabase table. Future invocations of this skill read those rules and adapt.

## Lessons learned
[Auto-maintained by `feedback_loop` skill. Each rejection adds an entry below.]
