# AI Video Platforms — Selection, Pricing, Prompt Architecture

**When to use.** You're picking *which* AI generation tool to fire and *what* prompt format to use. Image generation, photo-to-video, text-to-video, multi-image-to-video, voiceover, music. This skill is the source of truth for the platform landscape, current pricing, API access status, and the block-format prompt template that produces non-slop output.

**Read first:** [VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SKILL.md](../VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SKILL.md) §4 (the "AI when warranted" rules — interiors banned, hero exteriors + landscape inserts only). Then [`../quality_gate/SKILL.md`](../quality_gate/SKILL.md) — every AI clip must clear the 6-phase gate before it's stitched.

**Companion file:** [`platform_research.md`](platform_research.md) — competitive research dump from 2026-04-14 covering Veo, Kling, Runway, Pika, Luma, Sora-sunsetting, ElevenLabs, Suno, Synthesia, fal.ai. Refer back when a new model ships and you need a benchmark.

## The hard rule (re-read every time)

**No AI video for listing interiors.** Locked in v4b — Wan 2.7 cloud drift, Kling on a horse, Hailuo on a stagecoach all shipped as slop. AI is reserved for **aerials and exterior depth shots, abstract/macro/nature B-roll, stat-card backgrounds, and Synthesia-only avatars**. Never interior architecture, never reflective surfaces, never faces (except Synthesia, which is a separate skill at [`../news_video/SKILL.md`](../news_video/SKILL.md)).

For viral video specifically: **zero real estate visuals**. Visuals are science / nature / macro / abstract only. The stat overlay or VO is the only housing tether. (See [`../quality_gate/SKILL.md`](../quality_gate/SKILL.md) §1.3.)

### Deprecations / changes you must know

- **Sora (OpenAI) is sunsetting.** App ends April 26, 2026; API ends Sept 24, 2026. Source: help.openai.com/en/articles/20001071-sora-1-sunset-faq. **Do NOT build new pipelines on Sora.** Paul Trillo's Washed Out and Nik Kleverov's Toys R Us / Memory Maker pipelines are both transitioning away.
- **Luma raised $900M Series C** and is building Project Halo with Humain. "Modify with Instructions" is the new differentiator.
- **Kling 3.0** is currently #1 on video-gen ELO benchmarks.

## Mandatory prompt architecture

Every AI video prompt MUST use block format. Narrative prose paragraphs are BANNED. Tag-stacking is BANNED. Adjective-heavy prompts produce slop.

```
[SCENE: 1 sentence. Subject + specific action + location]
Camera: [focal length] + [movement type] + [angle]
Lighting: [specific fixture/technique] + [time of day] + [color temperature]
Film Stock / DP Reference: [named stock OR DP name. NEVER "cinematic"]
Color Palette: [3 specific named colors]
Speed: [f-stop for DOF OR fps for slow-mo]
Duration: [N seconds]
Negative prompt: [artifacts to avoid]
```

### Vocabulary that works

**Focal lengths:** 24mm (wide environmental), 35mm (documentary), 50mm (standard), 85mm (portrait compression), 100mm (macro), 135mm (extreme compression).

**Camera movement:** dolly in/out, gimbal tracking, crane up/down, whip pan, handheld, locked-off. Use exact phrases — vague verbs like "moves" produce inconsistent results.

**Lighting:** softbox, Kino Flo, practicals, rim light, chiaroscuro, volumetric.

**Time of day:** golden hour (3200K warm sidelight), blue hour (5600K dusk), overhead noon (flat high key), tungsten night (2700K warm).

**Film stocks:** Kodak Ektachrome (saturated vibrant), Kodak 2383 (warm classic), ARRI Alexa (neutral pro cinema), Fujifilm Provia (cool greens), Kodak Vision 250D (neutral filmic).

**DP references (instead of "cinematic"):** Roger Deakins (painterly high-contrast), Emmanuel Lubezki (naturalistic flowing), Bradford Young (rich deep shadows).

### Banned vocabulary (zero tolerance)

Delete these before the prompt fires. They signal slop:

`cinematic`, `epic`, `breathtaking`, `stunning`, `beautiful`, `amazing`, `gorgeous`, `premium`, `creamy`, `brooding`, `heavy`, `moody`, `4K`, `ultra HD`, `8K`, `high quality`, `masterpiece`, `professional`, `award-winning`, `best quality`, `extremely detailed`, `dramatic`, `magical`, `enchanting`, `mystical`, `ethereal`, `otherworldly`, `mind-blowing`, `jaw-dropping`, `photorealistic` (use specific film stock instead).

### Working examples

**PASS — Macro ice crystal formation:**
```
Macro close-up of frost crystals forming on a leaf.
Camera: 100mm macro, gimbal dolly left at 5% forward motion, f/1.4
Lighting: Golden hour rim backlight with cool blue shadows, diffused ambient fill
Film Stock: Kodak Ektachrome
Color Palette: cool cyan crystal, warm amber rim, charcoal leaf
Duration: 5 seconds
```

**PASS — Fluid dynamics (housing tether via stat overlay only):**
```
High-speed fluid dynamics: ink droplet impacts still water, mushroom cloud of expanding dye.
Camera: 35mm, locked-off on overhead rig, f/8 sharp focus
Lighting: Tungsten practicals above subject, cool blue fill from below
Film Stock: ARRI Alexa
Color Palette: amber plume, teal water, charcoal background
Duration: 4 seconds
```

**FAIL — Generic narrative (banned):**
> A beautiful stunning aerial drone footage of Bend, Oregon showing majestic mountains and cinematic golden hour light with amazing epic orchestral music vibes. 4K ultra HD masterpiece quality.

**FAIL — Real estate visual (violates hard rule):**
> A realtor walking through a modern luxury kitchen with stainless steel appliances and granite countertops.

## Photo-to-video pre-flight checklist

Run BEFORE firing any Kling / Runway / Veo call. Skipping = slop.

### Source photo (reject if any fail)

- [ ] **Depth:** clear foreground / subject / background layers (FG ≥ 8 ft from subject)
- [ ] **One focal subject** (no crowds, no competing elements)
- [ ] **No human motion required** (static poses only — walking/turning = morph hell)
- [ ] **No visible text/signage** (AI hallucinates text mutations)
- [ ] **Natural motion implied** (water, foliage, smoke, light, flags = permission for secondary motion)
- [ ] **Center-weighted composition** (primary subject in center 40–60%)
- [ ] **No fine-detail edges** (nothing critical within 10% of frame edge)
- [ ] **Landscape source, safe-crop to 9:16** (prefer 16:9 source, vertical-crop after generation)

### Prompt

- [ ] Block-format template exactly (scene, camera, lighting, stock, palette, speed, duration)
- [ ] Zero banned vocabulary
- [ ] Focal length specified (not "wide" or "tight")
- [ ] Camera movement explicit (dolly/track/lock — not vague "moves")
- [ ] Specific film stock or DP reference (not "high quality")
- [ ] Three named colors for palette (not adjectives)
- [ ] Duration 5–8 seconds unless explicit reason otherwise
- [ ] Negative prompt verbatim from `feedback_ai_photo_to_video_scale.md`

### Approval

- [ ] Matt has seen the brief and approved BEFORE the API call fires.

## Cost control strategy

```
1. Scout phase   → Kling 2.1 Standard, 720p, 5s, ≈ $0.02/clip
2. Iterate       → 1–2 variations at the same cheap tier
3. Matt approves
4. Hero render   → Kling 2.1 Pro 1080p 8–10s ≈ $0.08, OR wait for Veo 3.1 access
```

Never batch-generate at 1080p before Matt's approval. Iteration belongs at the cheap tier.

Elite-creator multi-tool workflow (confirmed across all 7 profiles in `quality_gate/`):
1. Concept iterations in cheap/fast tool (Kling 2.1, Grok Imagine Speed)
2. Hero shot in quality tool (Kling 3.0, Veo 3.1, Runway Gen-4.5)
3. Enhancement in Topaz Video AI (denoise + upscale)
4. Color grade in DaVinci Resolve or CapCut (kill the digital plastic look)
5. Edit + audio in CapCut (beat sync, text overlays, transitions)

Paul Trillo accepted a 95%+ reject rate (700 clips → 55 selected for the Sora music video). Treat AI as a camera that's expensive to roll, not a magic wand.

## Replicate Node example (Kling 2.1 i2v)

```javascript
const generateKlingVideo = async (imageUrl, prompt, duration = 5) => {
  const r = await fetch("https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Token ${process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      version: "kwaivgi/kling-v1-6-standard",
      input: { image_url: imageUrl, prompt, duration, aspect_ratio: "9:16" }
    })
  });
  return (await r.json()).id;  // poll this
};
```

Poll every 2s until `status === "succeeded"` → `prediction.output` is the video URL.
