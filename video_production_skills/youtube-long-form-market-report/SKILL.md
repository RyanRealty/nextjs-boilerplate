name: youtube-long-form-market-report
description: Generate a YouTube long-form (8-12 minute, 1920x1080 horizontal) market report video for Central Oregon — deep narrative arc using ALL 40+ market_stats_cache columns, chapter timestamps, mid-roll FAQs, agent commentary, and full SEO metadata for YouTube search. Use this skill whenever the monthly-market-report-orchestrator routes deliverable #2, OR whenever the user says "YouTube long-form", "long-form market report", "deep dive market video", "make me a 10-minute version of this market report", or asks for the YouTube video version of a market report. Do NOT use this skill for short-form vertical reels — those go to market-data-video. Long-form is the depth-of-coverage variant where every cache column gets a beat instead of being collapsed into a 30-60s summary.

# YouTube Long-Form Market Report Skill — Ryan Realty

**Scope:** Generate 8–12 minute YouTube long-form market analysis videos at 1920×1080. Uses every available column from `market_stats_cache` (40+ columns), top neighborhoods leaderboard, multi-year history, and agent commentary segments. Designed for "Bend Real Estate Market Report — April 2026" YouTube search intent.

**Status:** Locked 2026-05-07. Length target 8–12 min per Matt directive — long enough to use all the cache data, short enough to maintain retention.

---

## 1. When to use / when not to use

**Use this skill for:**
- Deliverable #2 from `monthly-market-report-orchestrator` (the YouTube long-form version of every monthly report)
- Standalone "deep dive" market analyses for YouTube
- Quarterly or year-end reviews where the data warrants a longer format
- Educational content tied to market data (e.g. "How to read a Bend market report")

**Do NOT use for:**
- Short-form vertical reels (use `market-data-video/SKILL.md` — 30–60s, 1080×1920)
- Listing tour videos (use `listing-tour-video/SKILL.md`)
- News clips (use `news-video/SKILL.md`)
- Anything under 6 minutes — the skill is built for depth; if the data only supports 4 min, ship the short-form instead

## 2. Format spec (locked)

| Parameter | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Resolution | 1920×1080 (landscape) | YouTube long-form discovery + search algorithm prefers landscape |
| Frame rate | 30 fps | Matches all Ryan Realty video output for consistency |
| Codec | h.264, yuv420p | Standard YouTube upload spec |
| Duration | 8–12 minutes (target 9–10) | Retention curve peaks 8–10 min for data-rich market analysis on YouTube; <6 min too thin for "deep" search intent; >13 min retention drops sharply (per VIRAL_GUARDRAILS) |
| Audio | AAC, 48kHz stereo | YouTube spec |
| Captions | Burned-in + uploaded SRT/VTT | YouTube auto-captions are good but not perfect for niche terms (Tumalo, Deschutes, Petrosa) |
| Bitrate | CRF 22 (high quality) | YouTube transcodes anyway; ship the cleanest source |
| File size | <500 MB | YouTube has no real cap, but smaller = faster upload |
| Chapter timestamps | Every section | Required for YouTube chapters feature + SEO |

---

## 3. Narrative arc (10-chapter spec)

The cache pre-computes 40+ columns. Long-form gets a chapter for each major data theme.

| # | Chapter | Duration | Cache columns featured | Visual |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cold open + hook** | 0:00–0:45 | `market_health_label`, headline `median_sale_price_sfr` | Title card + drone B-roll of city |
| 2 | **Median sale price + 4-year history** | 0:45–2:00 | `median_sale_price_sfr`, `_history.windows[4]`, `yoy_median_price_delta_pct_sfr`, `mom_median_price_change_pct_sfr` | Multi-color line chart (per market-data-video §19) + Matt voiceover |
| 3 | **Where the action is — price segments** | 2:00–3:15 | `price_band_counts` (5 buckets), `price_tier_breakdown` (6 tiers) | Histogram + tier breakdown |
| 4 | **Months of supply + market verdict** | 3:15–4:15 | `months_of_supply` (computed), `market_health_score`, `market_health_label` | Gauge + verdict pill |
| 5 | **Days on market — distribution** | 4:15–5:30 | `median_dom_sfr`, `speed_p25/50/75`, `dom_distribution` (6-bin histogram) | DOM histogram + percentile chart |
| 6 | **Sale-to-list + concessions** | 5:30–6:30 | `avg_sale_to_list_ratio_sfr`, `median_concessions_amount_sfr` | Bar gauge + concessions trend |
| 7 | **Cash buyers + affordability** | 6:30–7:45 | `cash_purchase_pct_sfr`, `affordability_monthly_piti` | Donut chart for cash% + PITI hero |
| 8 | **Top neighborhoods** | 7:45–9:00 | Direct query: top 5 subdivisions by closed volume + median + DOM | Leaderboard with subdivision photos |
| 9 | **What this means — agent commentary** | 9:00–10:30 | Matt's analysis tying all data to actionable buyer + seller advice | Talking-head segment OR animated text overlay on B-roll |
| 10 | **CTA + closing card** | 10:30–11:15 | static | "Subscribe + comment" CTA → locked Ryan Realty closing card |

Total: ~11 minutes. Adjust ±90s based on data depth.

## 4. Composition scaffold

**Install target:** `/tmp/remotion-yt-{slug}-{YYYYMM}/`. Same Remotion 4.0.290 stack as short-form, but with `width={1920} height={1080}` and longer durations.

```tsx
// 11 scene blocks — each maps to a chapter from §3
import { Composition } from 'remotion'
import { YouTubeMarketReport } from './compositions/YouTubeMarketReport'

export const RemotionRoot: React.FC = () => (
  <Composition
    id="YouTubeMarketReport"
    component={YouTubeMarketReport}
    durationInFrames={20250}      // 11:15 at 30fps
    fps={30}
    width={1920}
    height={1080}
    defaultProps={{ stats, photos, voPath, captionWords, chapters }}
  />
)
```

**Scene component pattern** mirrors `market-data-video/SKILL.md` §10 but at landscape dimensions. Reuse the same primitive components:
- `IntroBeat` (landscape variant — wider Amboqia title, scaled photo background)
- `StatBeat` (already supports `line_chart`, `gauge`, `histogram`, `multi_year_bars`, `leaderboard`, `takeaway`)
- `OutroBeat` (landscape variant)
- `KineticCaptions` (locked sentence-based caption renderer)

**Difference vs short-form:**
- Captions positioned at y 940–1040 (landscape safe zone), not 1480–1720
- Hero numbers larger (220px → 320px)
- Charts wider (W=920 → W=1620) so the multi-year line chart breathes
- Mid-roll talking-head segments — if Matt provides a recorded clip, embed via `<Video>` between chapters; otherwise use animated text + B-roll

---

## 5. VO spec (Victoria, narrative-only)

Same canonical settings as short-form (per `elevenlabs_voice/SKILL.md`):
- Voice: Victoria (`qSeXEcewz7tA0Q0qk9fH`)
- Model: `eleven_turbo_v2_5`
- Settings: stability 0.40, similarity 0.80, style 0.50, speaker_boost true
- One continuous synth call (no per-segment stitching)
- Captions sync locked to VO word timestamps (per `market-data-video/SKILL.md` §18)
- Narrative-only — VO does not recite numbers that are on screen (per `market-data-video/SKILL.md` §17)

**Scripted length:** ~1,400–1,800 words ÷ Victoria's 150 wpm = ~9–12 min. Keeps each chapter at the durations in §3.

**Per-chapter sentence templates** — same structure as short-form §17 but expanded with 2–3 additional sentences per chapter for depth. Long-form is allowed to interpret the data ("with concessions running at 3% of price, sellers are clearly making it work for buyers — that's a different posture than two years ago"). Short-form is not.

---

## 6. YouTube SEO metadata (required pre-upload)

Every long-form upload includes:

### 6.1 Title
- **Length:** ≤70 characters (YouTube truncates above 70)

## 7. Upload flow

Upload via YouTube Data API v3:

```bash
POST /youtube/v3/videos?part=snippet,status,contentDetails
Authorization: Bearer {YT_OAUTH_TOKEN}
```

```json
{
  "snippet": {
    "title": "{title from §6.1}",
    "description": "{description from §6.2}",
    "tags": ["bend oregon real estate", "..."],
    "categoryId": "22",                 // People & Blogs
    "defaultLanguage": "en"
  },
  "status": {
    "privacyStatus": "private",         // upload as PRIVATE first
    "selfDeclaredMadeForKids": false,
    "embeddable": true,
    "publicStatsViewable": true
  }
}
```

**Then upload thumbnail** to the same video ID.

**Surface to Matt:**
```
YouTube long-form ready for review (PRIVATE):
https://youtu.be/{videoId}

On "go" → flip to PUBLIC + ping the channel subscribers.
```

**On Matt's "go":**
```bash
PATCH /youtube/v3/videos?part=status
{ "id": "{videoId}", "status": { "privacyStatus": "public" } }
```

This locks the publish-on-approval pattern from CLAUDE.md draft-first rule.

---

## 8. Pre-render QA gate

Run after the Remotion render, before YouTube upload:

- [ ] Duration in [8:00, 12:00] window
- [ ] First 30 seconds: hook + title card complete
- [ ] Every chapter has a corresponding timestamp in the description
- [ ] Captions burned in + SRT/VTT exported (`out/{slug}/captions.srt`)
- [ ] All numbers on screen trace to verified data sources
- [ ] No banned words in caption stream OR script
- [ ] Audio: no clipping, no silence gaps >3s, RMS levels match short-form
- [ ] Outro: Ryan Realty logo + phone (per `listing_reveal/SKILL.md` locked closing card)
- [ ] Thumbnail rendered (1280×720, headline number featured)
- [ ] All JSON-LD VideoObject fields populated for the blog embed

If any fail, halt and fix before upload.

## 9. Cross-references

This skill is the long-form sibling to `market-data-video/SKILL.md`. They share:
- The same data pull (cache-first, SFR-default)
- The same brand tokens (NAVY, GOLD, Amboqia, AzoSans, Geist)
- The same VO voice + settings
- The same chart layouts (line_chart, gauge, histogram, leaderboard)
- The same banned-word rules

They differ in:
- Resolution (1920×1080 vs 1080×1920)
- Duration (8–12 min vs 30–60s)
- Number of beats (10 chapters vs 7 beats)
- Caption position (y 940–1040 vs y 1480–1720)
- Hero number scale (320px vs 220px)

When updating shared rules (e.g. voice settings, brand colors, banned words), update the canonical source file (per `market-data-video/SKILL.md` §22) and let both skills reference it.
