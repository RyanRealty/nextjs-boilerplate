# ElevenLabs Voice Skill

## Voice (LOCKED — permanent as of 2026-04-27)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | Victoria — Ryan Realty Anchor |
| Voice ID | `qSeXEcewz7tA0Q0qk9fH` |
| Saved as | "Victoria — Ryan Realty Anchor" on account |
| Locked | 2026-04-27 — permanent, no substitutions |

**No other voice is permitted.** Not Ellen (`BIvP0GN1cAtSRTxNHnWS` — predecessor, superseded 2026-04-27). Not any other ElevenLabs voice. Not any other TTS provider. Victoria only.

---

## Model selection

| Model | When to use |
|---|---|
| `eleven_turbo_v2_5` | **All production VO.** Fast, high quality, correct prosody on standard English. |
| `eleven_v3` | **Only when an SSML `<phoneme>` tag is required** (tricky place names below). `eleven_v3` supports IPA phoneme override; `eleven_turbo_v2_5` does not. |
| `multilingual_v2` | **BANNED.** Never use. Different prosody character, does not match approved renders. |

Decision rule: if the script contains any place name from the IPA list below, use `eleven_v3`. Otherwise, always `eleven_turbo_v2_5`.

## Canonical voice settings (single source of truth)

> **This section is the authoritative spec.** Every other skill file that references ElevenLabs settings MUST match these values exactly. When in doubt, defer to this file.
>
> Updated 2026-05-07 per Matt directive — tuned for conversational delivery; canonical source: `video_production_skills/elevenlabs_voice/SKILL.md`.

```json
{
  "stability": 0.40,
  "similarity_boost": 0.80,
  "style": 0.50,
  "use_speaker_boost": true
}
```

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `stability` | `0.40` | Lower = more expressive delivery; avoids robotic monotone |
| `similarity_boost` | `0.80` | Stronger Victoria identity across sessions |
| `style` | `0.50` | More dynamic delivery range |
| `use_speaker_boost` | `true` | Clarity on compressed social audio |

Any deviation produces a different-sounding voice and is grounds for re-render.

## `previous_text` chaining (prosody continuity)

Chain every sentence in a clip using `previous_text`. This gives ElevenLabs the prior sentence's context so the inflection at the start of each sentence sounds natural rather than isolated.

- For sentence N: `previous_text` = sentence N-1 (verbatim, no modifications).
- For the first sentence in a clip: `previous_text` = empty string or omit.
- Never skip chaining on interior sentences — prosody breaks are audible and are a QA fail.

---

## IPA phoneme tags for Central Oregon place names

Use these when the model is `eleven_v3`. Wrap the place name in SSML:

```xml
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dəˈʃuːts">Deschutes</phoneme>
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈtuːməloʊ">Tumalo</phoneme>
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈtɛθəroʊ">Tetherow</phoneme>
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɔːbri">Awbrey</phoneme>
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈtɛrəbɒn">Terrebonne</phoneme>
```

Plain-English pronunciation aide (for script review, not for API):

| Place | Pronunciation |
|---|---|
| Deschutes | "duh-SHOOTS" |
| Tumalo | "TOO-muh-low" |
| Tetherow | "TETH-er-oh" |
| Awbrey | "AW-bree" |
| Terrebonne | "TAIR-uh-bon" |

---

## Number-spelling rules

ElevenLabs renders numerals inconsistently. Spell all numbers out in the ingestion text:

| In video | In VO script sent to API |
|---|---|
| $475,000 | "four hundred seventy five thousand dollars" |
| $3,025,000 | "three million twenty five thousand dollars" |
| 4.3 months | "four point three months" |
| 12% | "twelve percent" |
| 2,847 | "two thousand eight hundred forty seven" |

Do not use commas as separators in spelled-out numbers. Do not use "and" before the last element (say "four hundred seventy five" not "four hundred and seventy five") — Victoria reads it cleaner without "and."

---

## Sentence writing rules

- **Short sentences.** Two clauses maximum per sentence.
- **No commas where Matt wouldn't pause.** If a comma would cause a weird mid-phrase pause in speech, remove it or split into two sentences.
- **No em-dashes.** No semicolons. No AI filler ("delve," "leverage," "tapestry," "navigate," "robust," "seamless," "comprehensive," "elevate," "unlock").
- **No banned real estate words** in VO: stunning, nestled, boasts, charming, pristine, gorgeous, breathtaking, must-see, dream home, meticulously maintained, entertainer's dream, tucked away, hidden gem, truly, spacious, cozy, luxurious, updated throughout.
- **First spoken word is content.** No "hey," "today," "welcome," or "let's talk about" openings.

## Python code example — canonical POST

```python
import os, requests, json

ELEVEN_API_KEY = os.environ["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"]
VOICE_ID = "qSeXEcewz7tA0Q0qk9fH"  # Victoria — locked permanent

def generate_vo(text: str, previous_text: str = "", output_path: str = "vo.mp3") -> str:
    """
    Generate VO audio using Victoria voice with canonical settings.
    Returns the output file path.
    """
    url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{VOICE_ID}"
    headers = {
        "xi-api-key": ELEVEN_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {
        "text": text,
        "model_id": "eleven_turbo_v2_5",  # use eleven_v3 only if phoneme tags present
        "voice_settings": {
            # Updated 2026-05-07 per Matt directive — conversational delivery; canonical source: video_production_skills/elevenlabs_voice/SKILL.md
            "stability": 0.40,
            "similarity_boost": 0.80,

    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    response.raise_for_status()
    with open(output_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    print(f"VO written: {output_path} ({len(response.content):,} bytes)")
    return output_path


def generate_clip_vo(sentences: list[str], slug: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Generate VO for a full clip by chaining previous_text across sentences.
    Returns list of output paths.
    """
    paths = []
    previous = ""
    for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
        path = f"public/audio/{slug}_s{i+1:02d}.mp3"
        generate_vo(text=sentence, previous_text=previous, output_path=path)
        previous = sentence
        paths.append(path)
    return paths


# Example usage:
sentences = [
    "Bend home prices climbed four percent this quarter.",
    "The median closed at four hundred seventy five thousand dollars.",
    "Inventory sits at two point one months of supply.",
]
generate_clip_vo(sentences, slug="news_bend_market")
```

---

## Forced-alignment (required for captions)

After every VO generation call, immediately call `/v1/forced-alignment` to get word-level timestamps for captions:

```python
def get_forced_alignment(audio_path: str, transcript: str) -> dict:
    """
    Fetch word-level timestamps for a generated VO file.
    Save the result as <audio_path>.words.json.
    """
    url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/forced-alignment"
    headers = {"xi-api-key": ELEVEN_API_KEY}
    with open(audio_path, "rb") as f:
        files = {"audio_file": (audio_path, f, "audio/mpeg")}
        data = {"text": transcript}
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files, data=data)
    response.raise_for_status()
    result = response.json()
    words_path = audio_path.replace(".mp3", ".words.json")
    with open(words_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(result, f, indent=2)
    print(f"Alignment written: {words_path} ({len(result.get('words', []))} words)")
    return result
```

The returned JSON contains `words[]` with `{ text, start, end }` in seconds. Map `start` → `startSec`, `end` → `endSec` before passing to `<KineticCaptions>`. Save the `.words.json` file alongside the `.mp3`. Captions will not sync correctly without it.

## Pre-flight checklist (before any VO generation)

```
[ ] ELEVENLABS_API_KEY loaded from .env.local (key name "ryan-realty-automation")
[ ] Voice ID confirmed: qSeXEcewz7tA0Q0qk9fH (Victoria — do not look this up from memory)
[ ] Model: eleven_turbo_v2_5 (switch to eleven_v3 only if phoneme tags needed)
[ ] Settings object typed out: stability 0.40, similarity_boost 0.80, style 0.50, use_speaker_boost true
[ ] previous_text chained for every sentence after the first
[ ] All numbers spelled out in full
[ ] Banned words grep: stunning/nestled/boasts/charming/luxurious/spacious/cozy etc. — ZERO hits
[ ] No em-dashes, no semicolons in script
[ ] IPA tags in place for any Central Oregon place name in the IPA list above
[ ] Forced-alignment call queued to run immediately after each MP3 generates
[ ] Output paths match the comp's staticFile() references before render
```

## Anti-patterns (instant re-generate triggers)

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Using any voice other than Victoria | Different prosody, different timbre — rejects at QA |
| Using `multilingual_v2` model | Wrong prosody character for English-only content |
| Using `eleven_v3` for non-phoneme clips | Slower, different voice character than approved renders |
| Skipping `previous_text` on interior sentences | Prosody breaks audible at sentence boundaries |
| Sending numerals ("$475,000") instead of spelled-out text | ElevenLabs mispronounces currency figures inconsistently |
| Using Ellen voice ID `BIvP0GN1cAtSRTxNHnWS` | Predecessor voice, superseded 2026-04-27, do not use |
| Skipping forced-alignment call | Captions will fall back to clock-time sync — violates caption hard rules |
| stability > 0.65 | Voice becomes monotone; loses the warmth that makes Victoria work for real estate |
