# Neighborhood Tour — Area Guide Video Library Generator

**Read `video_production_skills/VIDEO_PRODUCTION_SKILL.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (Data Accuracy section) before writing any composition code. Every market stat in a neighborhood tour must have a verified source. No "best of" claims without comparative data. No AI-generated neighborhood photos.**

---

## What it is

A batch-rendered library of 60-90 second vertical area guide videos, one per named neighborhood or community in the Ryan Realty coverage area. Each video uses a Google Earth Studio scripted polygon flythrough of the neighborhood boundary as the visual spine, with Remotion overlays showing median price, school data (GreatSchools or state DOE source only), drive time to downtown Bend, and a 2-3 sentence factual color paragraph sourced from verified per-city configuration. ElevenLabs VO reads a per-neighborhood script populated from that same config. All 19 are batch-rendered and stored as a library in `out/neighborhood_tours/`.

**Platforms:** IG Reels (1080×1920), TikTok, YT Shorts. Horizontal cut for the website area guides pages (`app/area-guides/`).

**Output length:** 60-90 seconds. Under 60s = not enough depth to be useful. Over 90s = algorithm cliff for this format.

---

## Neighborhood inventory — confirmed list

This list was confirmed against `scripts/seed.ts` (the canonical community/city list for the repo). Do not add neighborhoods that are not in this list without also adding them to `scripts/seed.ts` and the Supabase communities or cities table.

**Cities (Supabase `cities` table):**
1. `bend` — Bend
2. `redmond` — Redmond
3. `sisters` — Sisters
4. `sunriver` — Sunriver (city entry; see also resort community below)
5. `la-pine` — La Pine
6. `prineville` — Prineville
7. `madras` — Madras
8. `terrebonne` — Terrebonne
9. `tumalo` — Tumalo
10. `crooked-river-ranch` — Crooked River Ranch
11. `powell-butte` — Powell Butte

**Communities within or adjacent to Bend (Supabase `communities` table):**
12. `northwest-crossing` — Northwest Crossing
13. `old-bend` — Old Bend
14. `awbrey-butte` — Awbrey Butte
15. `awbrey-glen` — Awbrey Glen
16. `tetherow` — Tetherow (resort)
17. `broken-top` — Broken Top
18. `discovery-west` — Discovery West
19. `shevlin-commons` — Shevlin Commons

**Resort communities (batch-render lower priority — on-demand only):**
- `black-butte-ranch`, `brasada-ranch`, `eagle-crest`, `pronghorn`, `caldera-springs`, `crosswater`, `vandevert-ranch`, `petrosa`, `river-rim`, `three-pines`, `mountain-high`

The core 19 above are the mandatory batch. Resort communities are on-demand renders, not part of the weekly batch.

**Note on Gilchrist:** Gilchrist was listed in the skill specification but is not in `scripts/seed.ts`. Do not create a neighborhood tour for Gilchrist until it is added to the cities table. Flag this to Matt.

---

## When to invoke

- Initial library build (batch all 19 core neighborhoods in one run)
- Quarterly refresh (re-render any neighborhood where median price has changed by 5%+ or DOM has shifted by 7+ days)
- New listing in a neighborhood that does not yet have a tour video
- Area guide page on the website needs a hero video (`app/area-guides/`)
- On-demand for a specific neighborhood at Matt's request

Do NOT invoke for:
- Neighborhoods not in the confirmed list (add to seed.ts first)
- Any neighborhood where verified market data is not available in Supabase (no data = no video, no estimates)
- Any claim about school quality, walkability, or demographics that cannot be sourced to GreatSchools, state DOE, Walk Score API, or Census ACS

## Per-city config schema

Each neighborhood has a JSON config at `video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/configs/<slug>.json`. This file is the single source of truth for all non-Supabase data shown in the video.

```json

    }
  ],
  "banned_claims": [
    "best neighborhood in Bend",
    "most desirable",
    "top-rated schools"
  ]
}
```

**Every claim in `color_paragraph` must have a matching entry in `citations`.** If a claim cannot be sourced, it does not go in `color_paragraph`. The `banned_claims` array documents superlatives that were considered and rejected.

---

## Step-by-step workflow

### Step 1 — Confirm or create the per-city config

For each neighborhood in the batch:

```bash
ls video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/configs/
```

If the config does not exist, create it using the schema above. For each data point in the config:
- Pull school data from GreatSchools API or Oregon Department of Education (`ode.state.or.us`)
- Pull Walk Score from Walk Score API
- Pull drive time from Google Maps Distance Matrix API
- Research and write the `color_paragraph` from verifiable sources — municipal parks departments, City of Bend planning documents, Oregon State archives, neighborhood association websites
- Write one `citations` entry per factual claim in the paragraph

Do not include any claim that does not have a citation. "Northwest Crossing has a vibrant community feel" is an opinion and is banned. "Northwest Crossing has a town center with weekly farmers markets" is a fact with a source.

### Step 2 — Pull market data for the neighborhood

```bash
python video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/pull_neighborhood_data.py \
  --config video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/configs/<slug>.json \
  --output out/neighborhood_tours/<slug>/market_data.json
```

The script executes:

```sql
SELECT
  percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY close_price) AS median_price,
  COUNT(*) AS row_count,
  ROUND(AVG(dom), 0) AS avg_dom,
  MIN(close_date) AS period_start,
  MAX(close_date) AS period_end
FROM listings
WHERE
  property_type = 'A'
  AND city = '<city>'
  AND subdivision ILIKE '%<subdivision>%'
  AND status = 'Closed'
  AND close_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months';
```

Also pulls active inventory count:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS active_count
FROM listings
WHERE
  property_type = 'A'
  AND city = '<city>'
  AND subdivision ILIKE '%<subdivision>%'
  AND status = 'Active';
```

**Minimum row count for median:** 5 closed sales. If fewer than 5 closed sales in the last 12 months, widen to 24 months. If still fewer than 5, display the city-level median with a note "City-level median — subdivision data limited" in the overlay citation. Never display a median computed from fewer than 5 sales without the note.

Write verification trace to `out/neighborhood_tours/<slug>/data_trace.txt`.

### Step 3 — Build the Earth Studio flythrough

The neighborhood tour uses a polygon orbit path (flythrough around the boundary perimeter at low altitude) rather than the straight-line descent used in `earth_zoom/SKILL.md`.

```bash
python video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/generate_polygon_esp.py \
  --kml video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/boundaries/<slug>.kml \
  --output out/neighborhood_tours/<slug>/flythrough.esp \
  --duration 30 \
  --fps 30 \
  --altitude 800 \
  --orbit-direction clockwise
```

The polygon orbit starts at the neighborhood's NW corner, orbits clockwise around the boundary at 800m AGL, completing one full circuit in 30 seconds.

Import to Earth Studio, render PNG sequence, convert to video per `earth_zoom/SKILL.md` Steps 3-5. Use 1080p (not 4K) for neighborhood tours — the additional resolution is not visible in the final portrait crop and slows Earth Studio render significantly.

```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 30 \
  -i "out/neighborhood_tours/<slug>/frames/frame%04d.png" \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  out/neighborhood_tours/<slug>/flythrough_source.mp4
```

### Step 4 — Write and synthesize the VO script

Template (60-90s, ~150-200 words):

```
Beat 1 (hook): "<Neighborhood name>. <One specific distinguishing fact.>"
Beat 2 (context): "<What makes this area distinct — one sentence from color_paragraph.>"
Beat 3 (stats): "Right now, the median close price in <neighborhood> is <median_price>. Homes are averaging <dom> days on market."
Beat 4 (lifestyle): "<One verifiable lifestyle or access fact — from citations.>"
Beat 5 (schools/amenities): "Schools serving <neighborhood>: <school names from config>."
Beat 6 (drive time): "<Drive_time> minutes to downtown Bend."
Beat 7 (CTA): "Full neighborhood guide at ryan-realty.com."
```

Voice rules apply: no semicolons, no em-dashes, no "stunning", no "nestled", no "boasts", no AI filler language. Declarative sentences. Specific facts.

"duh-shoots" phonetic wherever Deschutes appears.

```bash
python video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/synth_vo.py \
  --config video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/configs/<slug>.json \
  --market-data out/neighborhood_tours/<slug>/market_data.json \
  --output-dir out/neighborhood_tours/<slug>/audio/ \
  --voice-id "$ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID" \
  --model "eleven_turbo_v2_5"
```

### Step 5 — Remotion composition

`NeighborhoodTourComp` at `video/neighborhood_tour/src/NeighborhoodTourComp.tsx`.

Beat structure:

| Beat | Duration | Content | Overlay |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | 5s | Earth Studio flythrough opening | Neighborhood name pill (Amboqia, 72px, navy pill) |
| 2 | 8s | Flythrough continues — wide view | Color paragraph sentence 1 (fade in) |
| 3 | 8s | Flythrough slows — mid-altitude | Median price + DOM stat card. Citation pill. |
| 4 | 8s | Flythrough at lower altitude | Lifestyle/access fact overlay |
| 5 | 8s | Flythrough final orbit | Schools: elementary, middle, high (source: GreatSchools pill) |
| 6 | 8s | Final descent toward neighborhood center | Drive time to downtown + Walk Score |
| 7 | 5s | Freeze on final frame + slow push | CTA: "ryan-realty.com" + area guide link |
| (end) | 10s | Freeze or slow push holds | No overlay — visual breathing room before platform chrome |

All stat overlay values come from `market_data.json` and the per-city config JSON. No hard-coded values in the Remotion component.

### Step 6 — Batch render all 19

```bash
python video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/batch_render.py \
  --slugs "bend,redmond,sisters,sunriver,la-pine,prineville,madras,terrebonne,tumalo,crooked-river-ranch,powell-butte,northwest-crossing,old-bend,awbrey-butte,awbrey-glen,tetherow,broken-top,discovery-west,shevlin-commons" \
  --output-dir out/neighborhood_tours/ \
  --concurrency 1
```

Runs sequentially (concurrency=1 — one Remotion render at a time to avoid Chrome OOM). Full batch estimated at 3-4 hours.

### Step 7 — Post-render QA and encode

For each neighborhood in the batch:

```bash
python video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/qa_batch.py \
  --output-dir out/neighborhood_tours/
```

The QA script runs:
- `ffprobe` duration check (60-90s gate)
- `ffmpeg blackdetect` (zero black sequences required)
- Frame extraction at 10s intervals
- OCR on stat overlays, diff against `market_data.json`
- Citation pill presence check (confirms source text visible on stat beats)

Failed neighborhoods are logged to `out/neighborhood_tours/batch_qa_failures.log`. Fix and re-render individually.

Final encode for each passing video:

```bash
for SLUG in bend redmond sisters ...; do
  ffmpeg -i out/neighborhood_tours/${SLUG}/tour_render.mp4 \
    -c:v libx264 -crf 24 -preset medium \
    -movflags faststart \
    -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
    out/neighborhood_tours/${SLUG}.mp4
done
```

---

## Anti-slop guardrails

Read `video_production_skills/ANTI_SLOP_MANIFESTO.md` before QA. Critical rules for this format:

- **No demographic stereotyping.** Do not characterize neighborhoods by who lives there. Describe the physical environment, amenities, and access. No implied demographic profiles.
- **No school rankings without a named source.** "Top-rated schools" is banned. "Summit High School — GreatSchools rating: 8/10 (pulled 2026-04-26)" is acceptable. If GreatSchools is unavailable, use Oregon Department of Education data with the URL.
- **No "best" claims without comparative data.** "One of Bend's best neighborhoods" is banned without a defined metric and comparison set.
- **No AI-generated neighborhood photos.** The Earth Studio flythrough is real satellite data. No generative fill on cloudy frames, no AI sky replacement.
- **Every claims in the video maps to a citations entry in the config JSON.** Run the citation coverage check before render:
  ```bash
  python video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/check_citations.py \
    --config video_production_skills/neighborhood_tour/configs/<slug>.json
  ```
- **No median from fewer than 5 sales without the "limited data" note.** The data pull script enforces this — do not override.
- **No city-level data presented as neighborhood-level data** (unless explicitly labeled as city-level with the note).
- **Manifesto rules 1, 2, 3, 5** apply: no hallucinated data, no AI filler, no ambiguous source, no unverifiable comparative claims.
- **Manifesto rule 8** (human review gate): first 30 days of library production — Matt reviews each video before it goes to the website or social.

---

## Brand rules

- **Colors:** Navy `#102742` for all overlay pills, stat cards, and CTA card. Gold `#D4AF37` for neighborhood name headline border and price accent.
- **Fonts:** Amboqia for neighborhood name headline. AzoSans Medium for all stat values, school names, and citation pills.
- **No brokerage logo in frame** during the flythrough segment. Logo may appear in the CTA end card (5s) only.
- **No agent name or phone in frame** during the video. CTA card shows URL only — phone lives in the IG caption.
- **Citation pills:** bottom-right of every stat beat, AzoSans 20px, white on semi-transparent navy. Format: "Source: [name], [date]".
- **Text safe zone:** 900×1400 px centered in 1080×1920.

---

## Data verification

Verification trace for every displayed number:

```
median_price   — listings, PropertyType='A', City='<city>', Subdivision='<sub>', CloseDate last 12mo, percentile_cont(0.5) = <value> over <n> rows, pulled <timestamp>
avg_dom        — same filter, avg(dom) = <value> over <n> rows
active_count   — listings, Status='Active', PropertyType='A', City='<city>', Subdivision='<sub>', count = <value>, pulled <timestamp>
school_data    — GreatSchools API (or ODE), school IDs documented in config, pulled <timestamp>
walk_score     — Walk Score API, centroid lat/lng from config, pulled <timestamp>
drive_time     — Google Maps Distance Matrix API, centroid to Brooks St, Bend, pulled <timestamp>
```

Write to `out/neighborhood_tours/<slug>/data_trace.txt`. Must exist before render starts.

- `app/area-guides/` — website destination for these videos

## Pre-Build QA (mandatory)
Before scaffolding the BEATS array or starting any render:
- Verify the format skill itself was loaded (this skill — required by `scripts/preflight.ts`)
- Pull all data from primary sources (Spark MLS, Supabase, Census, NAR, Case-Shiller — never from training data or memory)
- Write `out/<slug>/citations.json` with every figure → primary-source row before scaffolding BEATS
- Banned-words grep on draft VO + on-screen text BEFORE render
- Validate BEATS structure (12+ beats for 30-45s video, 3+ motion types, no beat over 4s)

## Storyboard Handoff (mandatory unless Matt opts out)
Before render, invoke `storyboard_pass` skill with:
- format = neighborhood_tour
- topic = <neighborhood or city name>
- target_platforms = IG Reels, TikTok, YT Shorts (+ horizontal website cut)
- research_data = <data pulled in Pre-Build QA step>

`storyboard_pass` returns the BEATS array, VO script, citation list, music choice, predicted scorecard. Show Matt the 30-second skim. On Matt's "go" → render. On redirect → invoke `feedback_loop` and re-storyboard.

Skip storyboard ONLY when Matt explicitly says "skip storyboard" or "just build it".

## Render
See format-specific render instructions above (Google Earth Studio polygon flythrough → Remotion overlay render). Command pattern:
```
cd listing_video_v4 && npx remotion render src/index.ts NeighborhoodTour out/<slug>/neighborhood_tour.mp4 --codec h264 --concurrency 1 --crf 22 --image-format=jpeg --jpeg-quality=92
```

## Post-Build QA Pass (mandatory)
After render completes:
- Auto-invoke `qa_pass` skill on the render output at `out/<slug>/neighborhood_tour.mp4`
- `qa_pass` runs all hard refuse conditions, auto-iterates up to 2 cycles on failures, writes `out/<slug>/gate.json`
- If `qa_pass` writes `gatePassed: false` after 2 iterations: the asset goes to `out/_failed/<slug>/` and Matt is told the system could not produce a passing draft. DO NOT show Matt the failed draft.

## Publish Handoff (post-approval only)
After Matt explicitly approves the draft in chat ("ship it", "approved", "publish"):
- Invoke `publish` skill with:
  - mediaUrl = <CDN URL after upload to Supabase Storage from out/<slug>/>
  - mediaType = "reel"
  - platforms = ["ig_reels", "tiktok", "yt_shorts", "pinterest"]
  - gate = <out/<slug>/gate.json contents>
  - captionDefault = <approved caption>
  - captionPerPlatform = <variants from publish skill best-practice matrix>
  - metadata = <platform-specific options like TikTok privacyLevel, YouTube tags, LinkedIn visibility>

The `publish` skill validates the gate (all paths exist, humanApprovedAt < 7 days), then calls `/api/social/publish` which fans out to platforms.

## Feedback Capture (on rejection)
If Matt rejects the draft or suggests a change:
- Auto-invoke `feedback_loop` skill with:
  - originating_skill = neighborhood_tour
  - asset_path = `out/<slug>/neighborhood_tour.mp4`
  - rejection_reason = <Matt's verbatim words>
  - render_metadata = <gate.json contents>

`feedback_loop` extracts an actionable rule, appends it to this SKILL.md under a `## Lessons learned` section (creating it if absent), and writes a row to `rejection_log` Supabase table. Future invocations of this skill read those rules and adapt.

## Lessons learned
[Auto-maintained by `feedback_loop` skill. Each rejection adds an entry below.]
