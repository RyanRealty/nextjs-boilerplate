/**
 * PATTERN 6: QUIET.
 *
 * "Hairline-separated supporting content (FAQ, proof, definitions, legal,
 * related links). Near-zero visual weight; carries the graph's outbound edges."
 * (design_system/public/PUBLIC_UI.md section 3, locked 2026-08-11.) No card, no
 * fill, no shadow: a rule, a lead-in, and either a destination or a short body.
 * It closes a node without competing with the answer above it, so it never
 * carries a primary action.
 *
 * WHAT SITE-40 CHANGED (taste table 2026-09-08). Six page classes — invest 25,
 * compare 29, about 31, market-report 41, reviews 48, contact 49, the bottom of
 * the whole site — OPEN on this primitive rather than closing on it, and the
 * evaluators named the same three causes on all six. (1) A prose-only item kept
 * the 72rem block and set its words at the 44rem measure, so a full-width
 * hairline ran under a two-thirds-empty row: "an unfinished card, not
 * restraint". Now a passage with nothing beside it IS the measure — one grid
 * track, and the rule stops where the words stop. (2) A passage could not carry
 * the live count the page had already fetched, so a page whose job is "here is
 * the inventory, here is the math" opened with no number. Now it can, in the
 * column that used to be void, with the §0 trace beside it. (3) N doors
 * rendered as N identical hairline rows — seven on /about, five on the market
 * hub, four on /reviews — which is TASTE.md's "scrolling lists as the design"
 * applied to a link menu. Now consecutive doors are ONE group: 2-up (3-up past
 * 60rem), each with the mark of the channel it opens, one of them able to lead,
 * and each able to print a live figure with its own source line. A narrow
 * viewport therefore reaches a face, a figure, or a map in half the scroll it
 * used to take.
 *
 * The pattern set is closed, so this primitive covers every shape section 3
 * names, not only the links slice. An item is either a door (`kind: 'link'`) or
 * a passage (`kind: 'prose'`): a question and its answer, a term and its
 * definition, or a titleless paragraph run for legal and proof. That is why
 * About can open on Quiet + Sheet without a caller reshaping its content to fit.
 *
 * MOUNTING: this section puts V3_ROOT_CLASS on its own outermost element, so
 * ./tokens.css resolves whether or not an ancestor already opened the scope
 * (re-declaring it is idempotent). Nothing here depends on a caller remembering
 * a class: without the scope every token in this pattern is invalid at computed
 * value time, which silently deletes the hairline that IS the pattern, the 44px
 * touch minimum, and the focus ring.
 *
 * WHAT IS MECHANICAL HERE, AND WHAT IS NOT. An earlier revision claimed the type
 * made "no dead ends" a compile error, through a non-empty tuple. It did not.
 * This repo's tsconfig sets `strict` without `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, so
 * `[rows[0], ...rows.slice(1)]` type-checks against an empty array, hands the
 * tuple an `undefined` head, and throws on the first property read during the
 * server render: a 500, which is strictly worse than the dead end the tuple was
 * meant to prevent. The tuple also refused an ordinary `.filter()` result, so
 * the remaining caller path was a cast that erased the guarantee outright.
 *
 * The guarantee now sits where it can actually hold, at render: an item with no
 * destination or no text is dropped rather than rendered nameless, and a block
 * with nothing left to show returns null rather than shipping a bare rule. A
 * caller passing zero exits has a dead end to fix in its own data; it does not
 * get this primitive's crash.
 *
 * Barrel law honored here:
 *  - Imports ./atoms, ./tokens.css, next/link, @/lib/utils, and catalog source
 *    from components/ui or components/motion when a class adapts a demo (SITE-76:
 *    shadcn Alert). Nothing from the deleted KB register, components/site (flat),
 *    components/site/primitives, or components/site/explore.
 *  - The region's name is required in the type AND it can only be given once:
 *    the props are a union of `heading` (a visible title, which becomes the
 *    name) or `ariaLabel` (no visible title). Passing both is a compile error,
 *    so the programmatic name and the visible title cannot diverge. A name that
 *    is only whitespace is not a name: it is trimmed away at render, and the
 *    element then renders as a plain container rather than as a landmark whose
 *    label a screen reader cannot read.
 *  - Every color, size, rule, and duration comes from ./tokens.css. No raw hex,
 *    and no hardcoded travel: the direction mark moves by --v3-travel, which
 *    collapses to 0 under prefers-reduced-motion.
 *  - No 'use client'. Pure server component: no state, no effects, no fetch, and
 *    no hooks, which is why the heading id derives from `id` rather than useId.
