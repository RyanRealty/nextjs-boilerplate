/**
 * PATTERN 1: INSTRUMENT. The answer, big.
 *
 * Visual language: design_system/public/PUBLIC_UI.md (locked 2026-08-11), pattern 1.
 * One verdict, number, or range in Amboqia, the supporting figures under a single
 * hairline, the series as a chart under those figures when the caller has one (D9),
 * the section 0 trace beneath, and the one ask the data earns. No ornament
 * precedes the answer. Opens Market nodes, carries a place market band, and reports the
 * valuation result. A series is never flattened to a figure.
 *
 * Provenance, stated exactly. The geometry is derived from that document. The moving
 * prototype at app/dev/public-v3/ demonstrates the same pattern and imports nothing from
 * this directory: it hand-writes its own global `.v3-instrument` rule against its own
 * token names (--navy-70, --edge). The prototype is a second implementation of the same
 * spec, so nothing here is proven by it, and the two collide on shared class names when
 * both stylesheets load in one document. ./V3Instrument.css holds that collision.
 *
 * Data contract, from CLAUDE.md section 0: every figure, the trace, and the freshness
 * stamp arrive already formatted by the caller through lib/format. This primitive never
 * fetches, never rounds, never derives a number, and never parses a date, so the string
 * on screen is the one the caller traced to a query.
 *
 * Barrel law honored here:
 *  - Imports only ./atoms, ./V3Chart, next/link, and @/lib/utils. Nothing from
 *    the deleted KB register, components/site (flat), components/site/primitives,
 *    components/site/explore, or components/ui.
 *  - Every name-bearing string is `V3Text`, not `string`. `string` accepts `''`, and an
 *    empty headline renders a region whose aria-labelledby points at an empty h1, which
 *    is a region with no accessible name at all. `headline=""`, `source=""`, and an
 *    empty action label are compile errors here.
 *  - The section id comes from the caller. Nothing is derived from the headline: verdict
 *    sentences are templated ("A balanced market"), the Places node renders a place
 *    verdict and a parent-market verdict on one page, and a derived id would give both
 *    sections the same id and point the second one's aria-labelledby at the first one's
 *    heading. Without an id the section names itself with aria-label instead.
 *  - `level` is required, so two Instruments on one page cannot both emit an h1 because
 *    a default chose for them.
 *  - Figures take an href, because PUBLIC-PRODUCT-OS makes every market stat a door and
 *    calls dead text naming a linkable thing a defect.
 *  - No 'use client'. Nothing here holds state.
 *  - No raw color. Every value comes from ./tokens.css through ./V3Instrument.css.
 *
 * Motion, deliberately absent. An earlier build counted each figure to its value over
 * 900ms on mount. PUBLIC_UI.md section 5 allows 600ms and longer only for a scroll-bound
 * sequence the visitor controls, and section 1 ships a motion only when it encodes a
 * state change the visitor caused. Arrival is neither, and a mount-triggered
 * requestAnimationFrame is not scroll-bound. A Market instrument settling is one of the
 * two moments the spec does allow, as a GSAP ScrollTrigger plus Lenis sequence bound to
 * scroll; when that is built it enters as a scroll-bound client child, not as a boolean
 * prop that fires on arrival. The retired implementation is V3InstrumentCount.client.tsx,
 * which this file no longer imports.

                    all fold without a label and all inherit this line.

                    A primitive cannot know what its caller's figures are about, so
                    the default stays generic — but generic and editorial, not
                    generic and numeric. Pass `foldLabel` and say the actual thing;
                    this is the floor, not the target. No digit, which is also what
                    fold-after.test.ts asserts of every label it checks. */}
