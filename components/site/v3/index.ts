/**
 * components/site/v3 — THE BARREL.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE PRESSURE VALVE. A migration that needs a control this set
 * does not have ADDS A PRIMITIVE HERE. It does not reach back into
 * the deleted KB register, the flat legacy files at components/site/*.tsx,
 * components/site/primitives, components/site/explore, or components/ui. Those
 * registers are a different visual language with a different token layer, and
 * one import from any of them puts two languages on one page, which is the
 * defect this rebuild exists to end. If a page needs something missing, the
 * work is a new primitive or a new prop on an existing one, reviewed against
 * design_system/public/PUBLIC_UI.md and exported below.
 *
 * THE PATTERN SET IS OPEN (Matt 2026-08-27). Six today; a seventh is allowed and
 * expected when a section's job is not one of them. Adding one is BUILDING one:
 * a component here, its own stylesheet reading ./tokens.css, exported below.
 * What is forbidden is the one-off — a page hand-rolling section markup with its
 * own look, which is a second design system arriving one page at a time.
 * Atoms grow the same way and always did.
 *
 * WHAT A CONSUMER GETS, AND WHAT IT STILL OWES:
 *  - Mounting: every pattern puts V3_ROOT_CLASS on its own outermost element,
 *    so a surface renders correctly with no wrapper. V3_ROOT_CLASS is exported
 *    for a page that wants the token scope around a whole route.
 *  - Data: no primitive here fetches, formats, rounds, or parses a date. Every
 *    figure, stamp, and trace arrives as a string the caller already formatted
 *    through lib/format, so the number on screen is the number the caller's
 *    source trace covers (CLAUDE.md section 0).
 *  - Names: every region and every control requires its accessible name in the
 *    type. The four patterns differ in how the run-time half is enforced, and
 *    each states its own discipline in its header: Stage throws in development,
 *    Instrument and Ledger take a branded V3Text built by v3Text(), and Field,
 *    Quiet, and Sheet drop what cannot be rendered honestly and warn.
