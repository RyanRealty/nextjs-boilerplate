# social_media_skills/

This is the social media and brand intelligence layer for Ryan Realty.
It pairs with `video_production_skills/` to cover the full content pipeline from
raw footage and market data to published posts, paid campaigns, and growth ops.
Load the relevant skill file before executing any social, brand, or content task.

**Pre-publish gates (mandatory on every piece, regardless of which skill produced it):**
- [`../video_production_skills/ANTI_SLOP_MANIFESTO.md`](../video_production_skills/ANTI_SLOP_MANIFESTO.md) — banned-content gate.
- [`../video_production_skills/VIRAL_GUARDRAILS.md`](../video_production_skills/VIRAL_GUARDRAILS.md) — pre-publish virality scorecard. Default ship floor: 80/100, format-specific minimums per §10. Every published piece (Reel, TikTok, Short, FB Reel, X video, LinkedIn video, IG carousel, Story sequence) ships with a `scorecard.json` proving the score.
