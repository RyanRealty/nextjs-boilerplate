# Agent Protocol — Ryan Realty

This document tells AI coding agents (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, etc.) how to autonomously pick up, execute, validate, and complete development tasks on this project.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# See what needs doing
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts status

# Get the next task with full specification
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts next

# Start working on a task
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts start <taskId>

# When done, validate and complete
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts validate <taskId>
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts complete <taskId>
```

## Sync Status Handoff (Mandatory for sync questions)

When a user asks about sync/backfill status, run this first:

```bash
node scripts/sync-status-report.mjs --json
```

Then use:

- `docs/SYNC_HANDOFF_PLAYBOOK.md` for decision flow and command options
- `/admin/sync` for visual confirmation

### Natural language trigger phrases (treat as equivalent)

If the user says any variation of these, the agent MUST execute the sync-status flow above before asking follow-ups:

- "what's the sync like"
- "what is sync status"
- "where are we at on sync"
- "research sync procedures"
- "research sync status"
- "tell me what options I have"
- "what can I run right now"
- "what should I run next"
- "start sync"

Required response format for these prompts:
1. Current snapshot (key counts + cursor state)
2. Health callout (moving, stalled, or rate-limited)
3. Top 2-3 commands to run now (from `docs/SYNC_HANDOFF_PLAYBOOK.md`)
4. Wait for user selection ("run option 1/2/3")

For "start sync", do not ask follow-up questions first:
1. Execute: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" "$BASE_URL/api/cron/start-sync"`
2. Confirm blockers cleared (`paused=false`, `abort_requested=false`, `cron_enabled=true`)
3. Confirm lane kick responses (`fullChunk`, `terminalChunk`, `deltaChunk`, `yearChunk`)
4. Report "sync running" confirmation with latest cursor timestamps

### Exact trigger: "Give me a sync status"

When the user says exactly or approximately "Give me a sync status", agents MUST return a detailed operational report, not a short summary.

Required details:
1. Current totals (listings, history rows, terminal remaining, finalized, verified full)
2. What is running right now (cursor phase, updated timestamps, paused/abort flags if available)
3. Last things that ran (recent year log entries + latest lane activity)
4. Approximate time to parity (ETA) with a clearly stated method and assumptions
5. 2-3 concrete run options the user can choose immediately

## How to Pick Up Work

1. Run `npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts next` to get the next prioritized, unblocked task
2. Read the full task specification output carefully
3. Check the file ownership matrix in `docs/plans/master-plan.md`
4. Run `npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts start <taskId>` to mark it in-progress

### Priority Order

Tasks are prioritized by:
1. Priority field: `high` > `medium` > `low`
2. ID order (earlier phases before later, lower IDs first)
3. Dependency chain (blocked tasks are excluded)

---

## How to Execute

### Rules to Follow

All rules in `.cursor/rules/` are mandatory. Key rules:

| Rule File | What It Covers |
|-----------|---------------|
| `design-system.mdc` | shadcn/ui components only, semantic color tokens only |
| `server-actions.mdc` | `'use server'` header, return `{ data, error }` never throw |
| `error-handling.mdc` | Server: return errors. Client: use sonner toasts. No `alert()` |
| `auth-patterns.mdc` | Use `getSession()`, `normalizeAvatarUrl()`, gate routes at top |
| `supabase-data-layer.mdc` | Use cached stats, correct client for context, never `select(*)` |
| `git-commit.mdc` | Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc. |
| `sliders-no-scrollbars.mdc` | Arrow navigation, no visible scrollbars on carousels |
| `master-plan-protocol.mdc` | File ownership matrix enforcement |

### Design System (Zero Exceptions)

- **Components**: Only use shadcn/ui from `@/components/ui/`. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full mapping.
- **Colors**: Only semantic tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`). No hex, no `bg-white`, no `bg-gray-*`.
- **Utilities**: Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes.
- **Fonts**: Geist Sans (`font-sans`) and Geist Mono (`font-mono`) only.

### Server Actions

```ts
'use server'

export async function doThing(): Promise<{ data: Result | null; error: string | null }> {
  try {
    const supabase = await createClient()
    const { data, error } = await supabase.from('table').select('col1, col2').eq('id', id)
    if (error) return { data: null, error: error.message }
    return { data, error: null }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('[doThing]', err)
    return { data: null, error: 'Something went wrong' }
  }
}
```

### File Ownership

The ownership matrix in `docs/plans/master-plan.md` is enforced. Check it before modifying files owned by another workstream:

| Owner | Key Files |
|-------|-----------|
| Reporting | `app/actions/market-stats.ts`, `components/reports/*`, `app/api/cron/sync-full/route.ts` |
| Engagement | `app/search/[...slug]/page.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `app/listing/[listingKey]/page.tsx` |
| Monetization | `components/AdUnit.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx` (banner), `app/guides/*`, `app/sitemap.ts` |
| Admin | `app/admin/*` |
| Shared | `lib/followupboss.ts`, `components/ShareButton.tsx` |

---

## Quality Gates

Run these before committing:

```bash
# Minimum (always)
npm run test
npm run build

# If you changed UI components
npm run lint:design-tokens

# If you changed routes or pages
npm run lint:seo-routes

# Full gate (recommended)
npm run quality:full
```

### Pre-commit Hook

Runs `npm test` automatically. If tests fail, the commit is blocked.

### Pre-push Hook

Runs `npm run quality:local:strict` (design tokens + test + build). Set `SKIP_LOCAL_GATES=1` to bypass (sparingly).

### CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

On PR to `main`:
1. `npm run lint` — ESLint
2. `npm run lint:seo-routes` — SEO route authoring checks
3. `npm run ci:design-tokens` — Design token compliance
4. `npm run test` — Vitest unit tests
5. `npm run build` — Production build
6. Build health metrics recorded
7. `npm run ci:lighthouse` — Lighthouse performance/a11y/SEO scores
8. `npm run ci:a11y` — pa11y accessibility audit
9. Bundle size report posted as PR comment
10. **E2E tests** — Playwright critical flow tests
11. **Visual regression** — Screenshot comparison against baselines
12. **Security scan** — npm audit + secret leak detection
13. **PR auto-labeling** — Labels by area and type
14. **PR metadata labeling** — Labels by area and change type

On merge to `main`:
15. **Automated release** — Changelog generated, version tag created, GitHub Release published
16. **Post-deploy smoke tests** — Key pages tested after Vercel deploy
17. **Preview deploy testing** — Smoke tests on Vercel preview URLs

Scheduled:
18. **Dependency updates** — Weekly (Monday 9am UTC)
19. **Security scan** — Weekly (Tuesday 8am UTC)
20. **Optimization loop** — Weekly (Monday 6am UTC)
21. **Stale branch cleanup** — Monthly (1st of month)
22. **Saved search alerts** — Daily (2pm UTC)
23. **Market report** — Weekly Saturday (2pm UTC)

## How to Validate

After implementing a task:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts validate <taskId>
```

This runs:
- File existence checks for the task's listed files
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run lint:design-tokens` (if UI files changed)
- `npm run lint:seo-routes` (if page files changed)

All checks must pass before marking a task complete.

---

## How to Complete

```bash
# After validation passes
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts complete <taskId>

# Commit with conventional format and push to main
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: <short description of what was done>"
git push origin main
```

## CRITICAL: Push to Main

**Always push directly to `main`.** Do NOT create feature branches. Do NOT create pull requests. Push to main and let CI validate. The orchestrator and task registry handle coordination — branches are unnecessary overhead.

```bash
# CORRECT
git push origin main

# WRONG — do not do this
git checkout -b feat/some-branch
git push origin feat/some-branch
gh pr create
```

The orchestrator automatically:
- Updates the task status in the registry
- Checks if the parent phase is now fully complete
- Updates phase status if all tasks are done

---

## Adding New Work

```bash
# Add a bug
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts add '{"title":"Fix broken avatar on mobile","priority":"high","category":"bug","owner":"engagement","files":["components/Avatar.tsx"],"acceptanceCriteria":["Avatar renders on mobile viewport","No layout shift"]}'

# Add a feature request
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts add '{"title":"Add dark mode toggle","priority":"low","category":"feature","owner":"shared"}'

# Add tech debt
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts add '{"title":"Refactor sync pipeline to use streams","priority":"medium","category":"tech-debt","owner":"reporting"}'
```

---

## Generating Reports

```bash
npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts report
```

Generates `docs/plans/continuous-improvement.md` with:
- Overall progress (complete/in-progress/open/blocked)
- Phase-by-phase progress with percentages
- Work breakdown by owner
- Current priorities sorted by urgency
- Blocked task list with reasons
- Backlog by category
- Recommended next actions

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Market stats**: Always use `getCachedStats()` and `getLiveMarketPulse()` from `app/actions/market-stats.ts`. Never compute stats on the fly.
2. **Listing URL**: Canonical form is generated by `listingDetailPath()` from `lib/slug.ts`. With full address data: `/homes-for-sale/{city}/{subdivision}/{key}-{zip}`. Fallback: `/homes-for-sale/listing/{key}`. The `/listings/` route redirects to `/listing/`.
3. **Team URL**: Canonical form is `/team` and `/team/{slug}`. The `/agents/` route redirects.
4. **Lead capture**: StickyMobileCTA and SiteLeadCaptureBanner must not both be visible simultaneously.
5. **Ad placement order**: existing sections → AreaMarketContext → AdUnit → Similar Listings → ActivityFeedSlider → RecentlySoldRow → Sidebar ad below CTA.
6. **Filter page links**: Browse-by UI links to `/search/{city}/{filter}` routes, not query-param URLs.

---

## Database Migrations

```bash
# Create a new migration
npm run db:migration <name>

# Push migrations to Supabase
npm run db:push

# Check for migration drift (pre-push hook)
npm run db:guard
```

Naming: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description_snake_case.sql`
Always idempotent: use `IF NOT EXISTS`, `IF EXISTS`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `npm run build` fails with type errors | Check for missing imports, incorrect types. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` for detailed errors. |
| Design token lint fails | Replace hardcoded colors with semantic tokens. See `CLAUDE.md` for the mapping. |
| Pre-push hook fails | Run `npm run quality:local:strict` to see what's failing. Fix or use `SKIP_LOCAL_GATES=1`. |
| Supabase migration drift | Run `npm run db:push` to sync migrations, or `SKIP_DB_GUARD=1` to bypass check. |
| Tests fail on CI but pass locally | Ensure env vars are set in GitHub Secrets. Check if test depends on Supabase connection. |
