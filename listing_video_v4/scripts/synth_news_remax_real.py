"""News clip VO — RE/MAX + Real Brokerage merger, ElevenLabs, prosody-chained.

Voice: Ellen (BIvP0GN1cAtSRTxNHnWS) — news anchor, declarative, paced.
Model: eleven_turbo_v2_5 (canonical Ellen — matches market-report config).
Settings: stability 0.50, similarity_boost 0.75, style 0.35, speaker_boost True.
Each sentence chains previous_text from same clip for prosody continuity.

(Updated 2026-04-27: model + settings aligned with market-report scorecards
that Matt approved. Prior eleven_multilingual_v2 + 0.55/0.85/0.15 produced
audibly different Ellen and was rejected.)
