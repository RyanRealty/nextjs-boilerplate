# Sync Handoff Playbook

This is the persistent handoff for future agents and future sessions.

## Single Source of Truth

- Visual dashboard: `/admin/sync`
- Machine-readable snapshot: `node scripts/sync-status-report.mjs --json`
  - **`strictVerification`** — Always include when answering natural-language sync status questions ("what's up with sync", "where are we at with sync", etc.). Gives `counts.terminalStrictVerifyBacklog` (what `sync-verify-full-history` processes), global finalized-not-strict counts, per-terminal `finalizedUnverified` buckets, and `adminDashboardForLiveDeltas` (`/admin/sync` live 15s deltas). See also `lanes.strictVerify`.
  - **`activeListingFreshness`** — Delta lane health for live inventory: `lastDeltaSuccessAt`, `deltaHealth`, `counts.deltaEligibleListings`, `activityEventsLast24h.byEventType`, and `pipeline` (how updates reach terminal and strict verify). Always include when the question touches active listings, freshness, or what is changing.
  - Terminal status counts (closed, expired, withdrawn, canceled) must use **`.ilike('StandardStatus', '%Withdrawn%')`** (or equivalent per column). Do **not** chain **`.or('StandardStatus.ilike.%Withdrawn%')`** with **`.eq('history_finalized', true)`** — PostgREST treats `%` inside OR filter strings as percent-encoding, which produced bogus withdrawn finalized counts (0) until fixed.
  - `yearsFinalization` uses **`listing_year_on_market_finalization_stats`** when the view exists (OnMarketDate calendar year). Year-by-year Spark chunk sync was removed; `runStatus` in `yearSummary` is `retired`.
  - `listingYearsBreakdown` is **`coalesce(ListDate, OnMarketDate)`** cohorts (can differ from OnMarketDate-only when those dates fall in different years)
  - `listingYearsOnMarketBreakdown` is the full OnMarketDate-only table (newest first)
- Runtime cursors in DB:
  - `sync_cursor` (fresh/full lane state)
  - `sync_year_cursor` (legacy row; year lane removed, may be stale)
  - `sync_state.year_sync_matrix_cache` (legacy matrix cache; no longer updated by a job)

## Finalization Definitions

- `history_finalized = true`
  - Listing is operationally finalized for history workflows.
  - May come from fast DB-path finalization when history rows already exist.

- `history_verified_full = true`
  - Strict Spark-verified full history pass completed.
  - Set only when history endpoints succeeded with pagination-safe retrieval.

- `history_finalized = true AND history_verified_full = false`
  - Finalized quickly, still eligible for stricter verification later.

## Core Commands

Use production URL and cron auth:

```bash
export BASE_URL="https://ryan-realty.com"
export AUTH_HEADER="Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

### 1) Freshness lane

```bash
curl -H "$AUTH_HEADER" "$BASE_URL/api/cron/sync-delta"
```

### 0) Start or restart all sync lanes (recommended recovery command)

```bash
curl -H "$AUTH_HEADER" "$BASE_URL/api/cron/start-sync"
```

### 2) Parity chunk lane (recommended default trigger)

```bash
curl -H "$AUTH_HEADER" "$BASE_URL/api/cron/sync-parity"
```

### 3) Terminal backfill lane

```bash
curl -H "$AUTH_HEADER" "$BASE_URL/api/cron/sync-history-terminal?limit=200"
```

### 4) Strict re-verify finalized-but-unverified listings

```bash
curl -H "$AUTH_HEADER" "$BASE_URL/api/cron/sync-verify-full-history?limit=200"
```

Year-targeted strict verify:

```bash
curl -H "$AUTH_HEADER" "$BASE_URL/api/cron/sync-verify-full-history?year=2025&limit=200"
```

Optional query param **`concurrency=1`** through **`concurrency=6`** (default **3** from env `STRICT_VERIFY_CONCURRENCY` or the cron URL) runs that many listings in parallel per invocation to shorten wall time. Raise gradually and watch Vercel logs for **504** or rising **`fetchFailures`** in the JSON response (Spark throttling).

## What To Run Based on Status

Run first:

```bash
node scripts/sync-status-report.mjs --json
```

Then decide:

- If `terminal.remaining > 0`: run `sync-parity` (and keep cron running).
- If `historyFinalizedUnverifiedAll > 0`: run `sync-verify-full-history`.
- If freshness lag appears: run `sync-delta`.

## Non-Stop Design

This system is intentionally chunked and resumable. It should run in production, not local dev:

- Frequent cron invocations
- DB cursors for resume-after-failure
- No dependency on a single long-lived local process

## Required Agent Routine (Future Sessions)

When user asks "what is sync status":

1. Run `node scripts/sync-status-report.mjs --json`
2. Summarize:
   - total listings
   - total history rows
   - terminal remaining
   - finalized vs strict-verified
   - current cursor phase/year
3. Provide next 2-3 command options from this playbook.

### Plain-language trigger mapping

Treat these as identical to "what is sync status":

- "what's the sync like and what options do I have"
- "research the sync procedures"
- "research sync status and tell me where we're at"
- "what can I do next for sync"
- "give me a sync status"
- "start sync"

Mandatory output shape:

1. **Where we are now**: short status summary with current counts
2. **What this means**: one-line interpretation (on track, stalled, or needs manual kick)
3. **Your options**: 2-3 concrete run commands
4. **Decision prompt**: ask user to pick one option and execute it immediately

For the exact prompt "give me a sync status", expand to include:

1. Current totals and terminal breakdown
2. Current lane/cursor state and whether jobs are actively moving
3. Last run activity (strict verify telemetry and cursor checkpoints)
4. ETA to parity with explicit assumptions
5. Action options (2-3 commands)

For "start sync", do this immediately:

1. Run `/api/cron/start-sync` with cron auth
2. Confirm blocker flags are cleared (`paused=false`, `abort_requested=false`, `cron_enabled=true`)
3. Confirm lane kick results (`fullChunk`, `terminalChunk`, `deltaChunk`)
4. Return a concise "running now" confirmation with current cursor timestamps

## ETA Method (Required in detailed status)

Use two recent snapshots to estimate throughput, then calculate a rough ETA:

- Throughput per minute = `(terminal_finalized_now - terminal_finalized_prev) / minutes_elapsed`
- Remaining minutes = `terminal_remaining_now / max(throughput_per_minute, 1)`
- Convert to hours/days and clearly label as an approximation.

If no previous snapshot exists, take a second snapshot after a short interval and then compute ETA.
