# SkySlope Forms file folders master audit

Generated (UTC): 2026-04-10T23:43:39.120Z

This report inventories **every listing file** and **every sale file** returned by the SkySlope **Listings/Sales** API in this account, including checklist activity scaffolding and the flat **Documents** library timeline.

## Important limitations (read this once)

- **Product scope:** This report uses the **SkySlope Forms** transaction **Files** API on `api-latest.skyslope.com` (`GET /api/files/listings`, `GET /api/files/sales`, etc.), i.e. listing/sale **file cabinets** tied to brokerage forms. It does **not** pull from **SkySlope Suite** (a different SkySlope application). It is also **not** the OAuth **Forms Partnership** developer API at `forms.skyslope.com`.
- **"Folders"** here means **SkySlope file folders**: one row per **listingGuid** (listing file) and one row per **saleGuid** (sale file).
- **Archived files:** Rows are **dropped** when status/stage text matches archive heuristics (or `isArchived` / `archived` is true). Set `SKYSLOPE_INCLUDE_ARCHIVED=1` to include them. Note: `GET /api/files` (unified search) supports an `archived` **status** filter but, in practice, can **omit** active under-contract listings (e.g. **Transaction**); this script keeps using **`/api/files/listings`** and **`/api/files/sales`** so the inventory matches SkySlope Forms file folders.
- **707 documents** existed at generation time across **10** listing files + **10** sale files. Fully OCR-reading every scanned PDF is a batch job; this report uses **API metadata for 100% of documents** and **PDF text extraction for a prioritized subset** (420 PDFs) focused on offers, counters, RSA/sale agreement language, and termination/release patterns.

### What “fully executed” means here (Ryan Realty standard)

A document is **fully executed** only when a **qualified human reviewer** (transaction coordinator, principal broker, or compliance) confirms **all** of the following for that specific instrument and property. **First classify the document**: listing agreements need **seller** (and firm/agent per form) signatures, not buyers; buyer agreements need **buyer** (and firm per form) signatures, not sellers; **mutual** instruments (RSA and many addenda/counters) need **both sides** signed where the form requires it—then judge completeness against **that** obligation pattern.

1. **Correct obligated parties** — The parties who **should** sign this document type are identified and match the deal, property, and (for mutual docs) the offer/counter context.
2. **Complete signing for that pattern** — Every required signature, initial, and date for **sellers only**, **buyers only**, or **both** (as the form requires) is present—not placeholders or wrong signers.
3. **OREF / Oregon / brokerage completeness** — Statutory and contractual requirements for this transaction are satisfied: required advisories, addenda referenced by the RSA, disclosures, and any brokerage-specific checklist items are present and the **correct OREF versions** are used where version matters.
4. **SkySlope file alignment** — Checklist activities and uploaded PDFs match what escrow and the brokerage expect for this stage.

**This script does not perform (1)–(4).** The “PDF text clues” column reports **extracted text-layer hints** (e.g. e-sign vendor strings). Those hints are **not** evidence of full execution and are **not** an OREF compliance audit.
- **PII is redacted** in excerpts (emails/phones). Do not commit live SkySlope session artifacts or presigned URLs.

## Proposed naming convention (do not rename yet)

Use a single sortable prefix and stable tokens so filenames group chronologically and humans can see the story at a glance:

1. **Prefix date**: `YYYY-MM-DD` from **uploadDate** (or **modifiedDate** if upload is missing).
2. **Lane**: `LIST` (listing file) or `SALE` (sale file).
3. **MLS** (if known) as `MLS-{number}` else `MLS-none`.
4. **Doc class** (machine token): examples `OREF-042`, `OREF-015`, `OREF-101`, `OFFER`, `CO-SLR-01`, `CO-BYR-01`, `ADD`, `AMD`, `SPD`, `LENDER`, `TITLE`, `EMD`, `MISC`. Derive OREF numbers from the filename when present.
5. **Round index** (offers only): `R01`, `R02`… increment whenever a new buyer offer package begins (heuristic: new "Offer" PDF with later date).
6. **Human review token** (suffix, optional): use `TC-PENDING`, `TC-OK`, or `UNKNOWN` **only** after a human applies the “fully executed” standard above. **Do not** derive `TC-OK` from e-sign marker counts.
7. **Original stem preserved** at the end for traceability: `__orig-{sanitized}`.

**Example (illustrative):** `2026-03-17__LIST__MLS-220199105__OREF-015__LISTING-AGREEMENT__TC-OK__orig-Listing-Agreement-Exclusive-015-OREF.pdf` (TC-OK only if a reviewer signed off).

## Executive summaries (one paragraph per folder)

These paragraphs are **machine-assisted** from SkySlope API fields + filename heuristics + (where available) **PDF text clues** (not full execution review). They are an **orientation map** only; OREF completeness and signatory correctness require a **human expert**.

Sorted by **uploadDate** (fallback **modifiedDate**). Each row includes an inferred **doc class** from the filename and optional **PDF text clues** when this document was selected for text extraction (still **not** a full execution review).

| # | Upload | Modified | Inferred class | File name | PDF text clues |

### Narrative timeline (best-effort)

- **Forms inventory**: 2 documents. Checklist activities: 10.
- **Listing file interpretation**: listing-side PDFs often include **multiple negotiation rounds** even before a sale file exists; use upload ordering + filenames like "Offer", "counter", and OREF counter forms.
- **Offer-like PDFs detected by filename heuristics**: 0 ("offer" family). **Counter-like**: 0 (includes OREF counter forms when matched). **Termination/release-like**: 0. **RSA / sale agreement-like**: 0.
- **PDF text extraction coverage**: 1 PDFs in this folder were text-extracted (global cap 420).

#### Suggested "deal story" paragraph (template)

Fill in the bracketed parts after human review of the PDFs: "This listing file for **[address]** (MLS **[mls]**) shows SkySlope status **Active**. The document timeline begins **[earliest doc date]** with **[earliest doc class]** and ends **[latest doc date]** with **[latest doc class]**. Negotiation PDFs suggest **[N]** offer-like uploads and **[M]** counter-like uploads; termination/release-like uploads = **[T]**. Based on SkySlope dates/status, the purchase agreement path looks **[completed vs not completed]** with confidence **[high/med/low]** because **[reason]**."

### Narrative timeline (best-effort)

- **Forms inventory**: 36 documents. Checklist activities: 10.
- **Listing file interpretation**: listing-side PDFs often include **multiple negotiation rounds** even before a sale file exists; use upload ordering + filenames like "Offer", "counter", and OREF counter forms.
- **Offer-like PDFs detected by filename heuristics**: 2 ("offer" family). **Counter-like**: 3 (includes OREF counter forms when matched). **Termination/release-like**: 0. **RSA / sale agreement-like**: 0.
- **PDF text extraction coverage**: 10 PDFs in this folder were text-extracted (global cap 420).

The document timeline begins **[earliest doc date]** with **[earliest doc class]** and ends **[latest doc date]** with **[latest doc class]**. Negotiation PDFs suggest **[N]** offer-like uploads and **[M]** counter-like uploads; termination/release-like uploads = **[T]**.
