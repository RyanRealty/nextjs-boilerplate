# docs/ — Active References

Last curated: 2026-04-21 (governance purge ch.3). Obsolete/snapshot docs moved to `docs/archive/`.

**Where things live.** This folder contains topic-specific reference docs. For authoritative architecture + status, look here first:

| I need... | Read |
|---|---|
| The canonical rules agents must follow | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (machine-enforceable) |
| Current task status / next open work | `docs/plans/task-registry.json` + `npx tsx scripts/orchestrate.ts next` |
| Workstream scope + file ownership | `docs/plans/master-plan.md` |
| Data architecture reference (URLs, stats, hierarchy, caching) | `docs/plans/data-architecture-plan.md` (body only — ignore any status stamps) |
| What the site does today (feature inventory) | `docs/FEATURES.md` |
| How the Supabase schema works | `docs/DATABASE_FOR_AI_AGENTS.md` |
| Work standards + design system + skill routing | `/CLAUDE.md` (root) |
| Cross-tool handoff state (Cursor ↔ Claude Code) | `docs/plans/CROSS_AGENT_HANDOFF.md` |

## Archive

Historical snapshots and superseded docs live in `docs/archive/`:

- `_audit-2025-03-12/` — March 2025 codebase + performance audits
- `_audit-2026-04/` — April 2026 audits (consolidated, sync, UI goals, lead capture)

- `_plans-completed/` — completed phase briefs + superseded roadmaps (Phase 0, Launch checklist, Spark replication roadmap + spec)
- `_stale-refs/` — docs that drifted from code reality (URL_ARCHITECTURE, NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF, DOCUMENTATION_INDEX, SUPABASE_AUTH_URLS, WHAT_I_NEED_TO_COMPLETE, SUPABASE_SCHEMA, older Spark field maps, etc.)
- `_generated-artifacts/` — machine-generated inventory reports (SkySlope folder audits, Gmail deep dive)

Archive is read-only historical context. Never cite an archived doc as current state — always verify against code + live rules.

## Contributing

- Before adding a new doc here, ask: does this belong in `.cursor/rules/` as an enforceable rule, or in `docs/plans/` as a tracked plan? Prefer those over loose reference docs.
- If you need to merge two overlapping docs, do it in one commit (merge + delete the donor) so history stays clean.
- Every doc should state when it was last content-verified against code.
