Verified live 2026-09-08 on 220226356 at four paths including an invented /portland/ one: all 200, index,follow, each declaring itself canonical. The duplicates in Search Console are the site's own output, not crawler-minted: every top pair is either a retired canonical shape (/outside-boundaries/... before the 2026-08-27 sentinel fix in lib/slug.ts:203-210; /jacksonville/na/... before the N/A filter) or a live mismatch, because ~15 internal builders call listingDetailPath with {city, subdivision} while listingCanonicalPath passes {boundaryCity, boundaryNeighborhood, subdivision} (app/_v3/home-field-items.ts:147-152, app/sell/_v3/sell-listings.ts:45-50, app/search/[...slug]/SearchPageJsonLd.tsx:136-152), and lib/kb/place-sections.ts:238 (buildActivityItems) and :192 (buildOpenHouseItems) pass no listNumber, subdivisionName or boundaryNeighborhood so listingDetailPath falls back to the 26-digit ListingKey (885 URLs, 3,348 impressions).

(b) one shared helper so hrefs and the canonical are built from the same fields, adopted by the ~15 builders and by place-sections.ts:238 and :192 (add ListNumber and NeighborhoodName to the ActivityRow type at :109; SubdivisionName is already declared). Add explicit fixture assertions for the 'outside-boundaries' and 'na' segments (generation is already gated at lib/slug.test.ts:90 and the sitemap's 7,506 listing URLs contain zero of either, so a sample of live URLs can never hit one and would stay green for the wrong reason).",

The threshold is not the variable. `boundaries` (3,223 rows, geo_type='subdivision') is at recorded-plat grain from Deschutes County GIS; the closed-sale count is a text join on MLS SubdivisionName, which is at resort grain ('Broken Top' 448 closed, 'Tetherow' 586, 'Black Butte Ranch' 132, in listing_tile_mv AND in raw listings).

Fix: attribute closed sales to a plat by point-in-polygon (listing_boundary_xref_mv already does this for actives) or map each plat polygon to its containing MLS subdivision, then apply the existing floor to the rolled-up count. Check polygon quality first (memory reference_neighborhood_sold_attribution_broken: broken-top's polygon measures 17.96 sq mi against Bend's 35.45); for indexability the count is only a gate input, not a published figure, which makes it a safer first use than months of supply. subdivision-index.test.ts:31 pins the floor at 10; leave the floor, change the join. getIndexableSubdivisions is cached 6h and geo.xml revalidates hourly, so bust both before asserting.",

(1) MAX_TITLE=60 at :20 truncates at :73-80 and app/layout.tsx:46 THEN appends the 31-character ' | Ryan Realty — Central Oregon', so long plat names lose the phrase people search: /subdivisions/rock-ridge-cabin-sites-of-black-butte-ranch ships 'Homes for Sale in Rock Ridge Cabin Sites of Black Butte | ...' (Ranch cut), river-ridge-two-condominiums-at-mt-bachelor-village-stage-b loses 'Bachelor Village', eight more end on a bare 'Central'. The dangling-token regex at :78 covers |·—–- but not & or +, so hayden-homes-amphitheater ships '... Live Music & | Ryan Realty — Central Oregon'. scripts/check-content-metadata.mjs bounds registry names to 48 chars but never counts the suffix and does not cover parks. (2) Every detail page in four registry families renders 'Central Oregon' twice in the title before the layout adds it a third time (/parks/smith-rock is live at 75 chars), and the description is a per-family fill-in-the-blank whose only variable is the entity name (sawyer-park and big-sky-park are byte-identical apart from the name) with a 24-char brokerage tail that pushes several past shareDescription's 155-char cap into '…'.

Fix: make the 60-char budget account for the suffix (emit title: { absolute } from pageMetadata, or budget ~30 for suffixed pages); cover & and + in the dangling regex; drop the category label and the brand tail from all four registry templates and lead the description with the blurb's first sentence, budgeting the full 155 (7 of 20 venues overflow the naive first-sentence-plus-address formula); keep generateMetadata registry-only (the page contract and scripts/check-prerender-db-safety.mjs bar a DAL call there; an event's nextConfirmedDate is registry data and may be used); resolve the plat's city from the boundary read; teach check-content-metadata to count the suffix and to cover parks. Also change :128 so noindex no longer forces nofollow (`noindex, follow` by default, an explicit nofollow flag for the paid-arrival /lp pages that want it): ~580 rendered noindex pages each carry ~200 internal links Google is told to drop, and pageMetadata currently cannot express {index:false, follow:true} at all, which SITE-32 will need.

Both descriptions are number-free while the pages compute closed count, median price and median DOM (sales page :153-170). (b) The sales page's JSON-LD points off-route: :196 builds canonicalLiveUrl at /housing-market/reports/sales/... and feeds the BreadcrumbList last item (:245) and the Dataset url (:255); no such route exists.

MASTER_SPEC:1942 wins; data-architecture-plan:1095's noindex recommendation is the losing text and is to be deleted. Closed detail pages showing ClosePrice are NOT treated as a VOW-only sold surface under ODS A.4 for indexing. The gate pins index,follow on off-market rows; SITE-21 is what those URLs serve. No code path in the listing route emits noindex for any status except Coming Soon: app/listing/[listingKey]/page.tsx:160-165 calls pageMetadata() without noindex, lib/site/page-metadata.ts:128 defaults to index, follow, lib/listing-status-public.ts:75-77 makes every other status publicly displayable. Confirmed live: an Expired listing at /homes-for-sale/outside-boundaries/9184-evans-cr-220169791 returns 200 index,follow self-canonical. Measured by crossing the GSC page report against the DAL (2026-06-08..2026-09-05): 14,508 listing-detail URLs, 11,629 unique MLS, 56,650 impressions, 807 clicks; off-market is 6,611 URLs and 26,123 impressions (46%): Closed 3,207/12,125, Pending 1,431/6,105, Expired 790/3,226, Canceled 748/2,860, Withdrawn 435/1,807. These are residual index: the sitemap is Active/AUC only (getListingSitemapRows.ts:64,83). Two policies exist in writing. docs/MASTER_SPEC.md:1693 and :1942: 'Do not return HTTP 404 for sold listings — return HTTP 200 with this state. Google will continue to index the URL as a relevant similar-homes landing page' (keep indexed). docs/plans/data-architecture-plan.md:1095: keep the page, add noindex, availability SoldOut, sold price and date, related actives, optionally 410 after 12 months (noindex). Neither is implemented and no gate exists. The verifier's numbers argue for care: off-market URLs earn a CTR that straddles or beats Active, roughly 324-577 clicks per 90 days, 24-42% of all site organic clicks, and an address query has no Active substitute, so a noindex deletes those clicks rather than redistributing them. SITE-21 makes those landings honest regardless of the ruling. A second, separate question sits under it: G54 pins ODS §5-4 A.4 as 'SOLD data is VOW-only, no indexable public sold surface may exist' (scripts/check-ods-compliance.mjs:18-20) but checks only search presets and statusFilter variants; a Closed detail page publicly showing ClosePrice at index,follow may be inside that rule. If it is, the noindex is a compliance requirement, applies to Closed only (not Expired/Canceled/Withdrawn/Pending), belongs in G54 rather than a new gate, and must be {index:false, follow:true}, which pageMetadata cannot emit until SITE-25 lands. Implementation notes for whichever ruling: the two chokepoints are page.tsx:160-165 and app/listing/by-address/[...slug]/page.tsx:73-84, whose canonical-drop branch at :77 recognises only the OBJECT robots form; delete the losing doc text rather than leaving both; write the winner into CLAUDE.md or the owning skill; correct ListingUnavailable.tsx:5-8.",

The real asymmetry is one level down: the CITY tier has an honesty block ('Outside our Central Oregon market') and a noindex policy; the LISTING tier beneath it has neither, so a Rogue River listing renders identically to a Bend one under the '| Ryan Realty — Central Oregon' suffix with no signal that this is not our market.

(1) A prose-only Quiet item reserves a figure column that renders empty: on /invest roughly the right 45% of the 1120px content width is void beside each paragraph, 'an unfinished card, not restraint'. (2) Link rows as the design: /about's first screen is seven identical hairline rows (Principal broker, Call, Text, Email, Schedule, Client reviews, Contact); /reviews meets four identical arrow rows before a single star; /housing-market's chooser is five plain rows (Live market, By city, Explore, Sales weekly, Months of supply) with no number; the banned tell 'scrolling lists as the design' applied to a link menu. (3) No figure slot: the first Quiet item on /invest cannot carry the live count the page already fetches, so the fold has no number.

      "Matt 2026-09-09, reading the page the CMA first message now sends expired sellers to: 'There's no map on the diamond bar sub page and no photo.' Verified the same day in a headless Chromium render of /subdivisions/diamond-bar-ranch at 1440x2600 after 7s, and again in the in-app pane: the opening is the breadcrumb, the H1 and a source line on cream with no photograph; the 'Diamond Bar Ranch right now' atlas (id=atlas) is an empty grey frame with + and - controls and a legend reading '1 for sale · House · Just listed in Diamond Bar Ranch, $460,000', no basemap visible, no dot, no plat outline (the DOM holds 2 svgs with 23 paths and 0 dot circles); and the 'Every home on the market around Diamond Bar Ranch' split view (id=homes, MapSearchView on Google Maps, window.google present) lists the one home with its photo beside a blank map area with no tiles. Cause, in app/subdivisions/[slug]/page.tsx: Diamond Bar Ranch has no polygon in `boundaries` and no registry alias, so it renders through the MLS-name path (loadSubdivisionCore, name tiles); seedRing is false, atlasRegions is empty, and the atlas is framed with basemapForRegions([], {dots, fit: 'dots'}) (:948-952) around a single dot, so the frame has no span; the poster is platOwnPoster = cityStagePoster(communityImage(slug), platLibraryHeroUrl) (:606), null for a plain plat with no dedicated still and no geo-strict library hero, and the SITE-08 pass-2 comment above it refuses a city or listing photo standing in for the place, so the page opens on cream by design. Scale, measured 2026-09-09 through the DAL (scripts/_plats-without-polygons.ts: getListingTiles active SFR, 1,000-tile sample, against getSubdivisionBoundarySlugs and the registry): at least 265 plain plats with live SFR homes and no recorded polygon, 511 homes, a lower bound because of the sample cap; The Reserve In The Pines Phase 2 (17 homes), Dry Canyon (15), Acadia Pointe Phase 5 and 6 (10), Willowbrook (10), Collier (9) lead it. This is the page the expired letter links (lib/cma/first-contact-place.ts links a plat only when it renders, and this one renders), so a seller who clicks lands on cream and two blank maps. Fix, in the primitives: (1) the atlas frame for a plat with no polygon is built from its homes' coordinates with a minimum span (a quarter mile or the nearest-roads tier), the basemap the CMA map already draws for any coordinate (lib/cma/map-ground.ts: TIGER roads, water, labels, fractional zoom) or basemapForFrame with a floor on the bbox, the plat's homes as dots, and lots where the county has them; a single home is still a map. (2) Find why MapSearchView paints no tiles on this route in a headless render (bounds from BEND_DEFAULT_BOUNDS or the plat's tiles, the key's referrer rules, or the pane not receiving a size) and fix it in the component, not the page. (3) The opening carries an image on every plat: the plat's own listing exterior captioned as that listing ('2623 6th Drive, for sale in Diamond Bar Ranch'), the geo-strict library hero where one exists (data/asset-library, vision-graded), or the plat's own drawn ground as the opening image; a caption always names what the frame is; never a city photo, never another plat's, never cream. §0 applies to a picture exactly as to a number.

The renderer is what went: components/site/listing-detail/DescriptionBlock.tsx rendered them and the 12-section rebuild 7c40065e dropped its import, listing-remainder-contract.test.ts then asserted its absence, and the orphan cleanup 545e4e50 deleted the component and, as a cascade, lib/listing/publish-listing-remarks.ts — the paragraph joiner whose whole job is that Spark inserts a blank line mid-sentence and a naive split leaves a truncated first paragraph.

Restore the remarks to the rendered page as their own row in the page inventory (the contract comment at app/listing/[listingKey]/page.tsx:110 says 12 rows and the contract test enumerates them; both change together), in the v3 register the rebuilt page uses rather than the deleted component's legacy classes, with the joiner restored and its behaviour tested. Words are never invented, never rewritten, never summarised; a clamp with a control that reveals the rest is fine, a truncation that ends the sentence for the reader is not. ODS: remarks are listing data displayed under the existing ListingAttribution, which already names the listing firm — do not re-attribute, do not add a second attribution.

Of 1,087 distinct SubdivisionName values on 3,573 active SFR listings, 626 resolve to no recorded plat by name or by polygon even after SITE-56's phase-prefix and boundary_subdivision resolver, and the list is dominated by places outside Deschutes: Brasada Ranch 39 homes, Running Y Resort 26, Crooked River Ranch 13, Ochoco Pointe 10, Willowbrook 10, the Klamath Falls Hot Springs and Buena Vista additions 12 and 11, Ridgewater Phase 1 9, Haystack Butte 7. Probed the same day: Deschutes publishes layer 4 Subdivisions at maps.deschutes.org/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/BoundaryFD/MapServer, which is what we already hold in full; the Klamath County org we already pull taxlots from (services.arcgis.com/H6Mh1bySxR4oHx6x, 201 services) publishes no subdivisions layer, only SPR_Submissions; the Josephine org (services3.arcgis.com/qwqIu50nUr6wRrbz) returned no services at that path; two guessed Crook endpoints 404'd. So the endpoints have to be found, not guessed: start from each county's open-data portal and its assessor/surveyor pages, and treat a recorded-plat layer as the only acceptable source (memory feedback_gis_authoritative_only) — a hull drawn around listing points is not a plat boundary and must never be published as one. We already ingest taxlots from four counties (scripts/gis/import-taxlots.mjs, 246,873 rows across deschutes, klamath, josephine and a City of Medford slice), so the ingest pattern, the provenance columns and the ci:boundary-provenance floor all exist and this is a matter of finding the layer and running it.

The two halves both exist and nothing joins them. scripts/taste-table.mjs scores every public class, writes design_system/public/taste-table.json, and --diff prints every class whose median is under FINISH_LINE (70, scripts/lib/taste-table-core.mjs). scripts/seed-site-queue.ts holds the backlog as a hardcoded SEEDS array, upserts by version_gap and never touches an existing node's state. The seeder NEVER READS the table — verified by grep, the only mention of taste-table.json inside the seeder is prose in SITE-51's own description — and neither script is on a cron. So the path from 'this class scored 52' to 'a node exists a session can claim' runs through a person hand-writing a TypeScript object. That is the one manual hop in an otherwise automatic loop, and it is exactly where a round stalls silently: Matt's ruling 3 of 2026-09-09 is to re-measure all 25 classes and seed the next round from the bottom, and today the measuring half will finish and produce nothing claimable. WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not auto-seeding. A node written by a machine from a score is a node with no diagnosis, and the queue's value is that each row states a cause and an accept test. The tool emits a DRAFT for review, keyed to the class, carrying the score, the evaluator's own defects with their owning primitives, and the shot paths; a person edits it and decides whether it ships. Review-and-paste instead of compose-from-scratch. NUMBERING IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE HOP: the next free version_gap has to be read off the existing seeds, not guessed, or two rounds collide on one id. THE SEEDER ITSELF IS HALF THE BUG AND IS IN SCOPE: scripts/seed-site-queue.ts upserts with ignoreDuplicates:true, so the FIRST writer of a version_gap wins and every later seed for that id is dropped with no error, no warning and no row. That is not theoretical — on 2026-09-10 this lane seeded SITE-60 at 02:23 while main's committed seed file already claimed SITE-60 for the prefetch finding; the other session's seeder ran at 02:41, its row was ignored, and a measured finding (78 requests, 25,386,060 bytes) existed in no node under any id until it was repaired by hand.

A builder is handed adjectives — quiet, editorial, expensive, Stripe restraint — and TASTE.md's own diagnosis says what happens next: 'absent a specific instruction, the model reaches for the statistically safest layout,' which here is the stacked-section page. Three changes, in payoff order. (1) REFERENCES PER CLASS, not adjectives. TASTE.md's 'Reference-driven, not adjective-driven' section already says the method — 'write down three to five references and what specifically works in each', 'point the builder at REAL component code to adapt', 'feed a machine-readable token sheet' — and it has never been done for a single one of the 27 classes. Create design_system/public/references/<class>.md for the classes under 70, each naming two or three real pages (the portal's version, the subject's own site, a piece of editorial data journalism) with ONE sentence per reference saying what specifically works, plus at least one shipped component's actual markup and CSS to adapt rather than generate from a description. A class's node then cites its reference file, and the evaluator is given it so 'beats' is judged against something named instead of invented. (2) VARIANTS BEFORE A WINNER. TASTE.md's 'variants rule' says a NEW data-display section ships as two or three named variants behind one prop, rendered side by side on a decision sheet for Matt to pick, losers DELETED in the commit that records the pick. It has never once been used, and it is the only step where Matt's taste enters the loop instead of a model's. Make it real: a `--variants` mode on scripts/take-route-shots.mjs that captures each variant at both viewports into one sheet, a published decision sheet, and the pick written on the node. (3) THE EVALUATOR NAMES THE REPLACEMENT FORM. Today it says 'static figure row, banned KPI grid' — a diagnosis with no prescription, so the builder invents. It must name which house form replaces it from the dataviz preference order in TASTE.md (hero figure, stat tile with sparkline, emphasis line with a scrubber, horizontal bar, dot strip, slope, small multiples, beeswarm, map with data-encoded cells), so a builder chooses among known-good shapes. Add that to design_system/public/taste-evaluator.v1-2026-09-08.md and bump the rubric version, which rebaselines by design. This node changes the PROCESS; it does not itself rebuild a page.
